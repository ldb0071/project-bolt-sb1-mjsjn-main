# Latest Updates

## Shape Drawing Functionality
- Fixed shape preview during drawing process
- Corrected position calculation for final shape placement
- Added proper coordinate transformations between screen and flow coordinates
- Improved shape rendering with semi-transparent preview

### Key Components:

1. **Mouse Event Handlers**:
```typescript
handlePaneMouseDown:
- Captures initial mouse position relative to canvas
- Initializes drawing context with random color
- Sets up drawing state

handlePaneMouseMove:
- Calculates shape dimensions based on mouse movement
- Clears and redraws shape preview
- Handles aspect ratio constraints (Shift key)
- Renders semi-transparent preview (50% fill, 80% stroke)

handlePaneMouseUp:
- Calculates final position using ReactFlow's project function
- Creates final node with correct position and dimensions
- Adds node to active layer
- Cleans up drawing state
```

2. **Coordinate Handling**:
```typescript
// Screen to Flow coordinate conversion
const position = project({
  x: width > 0 ? shapeStartPoint.x : shapeStartPoint.x + width,
  y: height > 0 ? shapeStartPoint.y : shapeStartPoint.y + height
});

// Shape dimensions in flow coordinates
width: Math.abs(width / viewport.zoom),
height: Math.abs(height / viewport.zoom)
```

3. **Drawing Preview**:
- Uses canvas overlay for real-time shape preview
- Maintains proper aspect ratio when Shift is held
- Shows semi-transparent preview while drawing
- Clears preview when shape is finalized

4. **Shape Creation**:
- Accurate position calculation using ReactFlow's coordinate system
- Proper dimension scaling based on viewport zoom
- Adds shape to correct layer
- Maintains shape properties (color, type, dimensions)

## Current Features:
- Real-time shape preview while drawing
- Accurate shape positioning
- Aspect ratio constraint with Shift key
- Semi-transparent preview
- Proper coordinate transformations
- Layer management
- Multiple shape types (rectangle, circle, triangle, hexagon)

## Usage:
1. Select shape tool
2. Choose shape type
3. Click and drag to draw
4. Hold Shift for aspect ratio constraint
5. Release to create shape

## Known Behaviors:
- Preview shows in screen coordinates
- Final shape positions in flow coordinates
- Shape dimensions scale with zoom level
- Preview uses semi-transparent fill and stroke
