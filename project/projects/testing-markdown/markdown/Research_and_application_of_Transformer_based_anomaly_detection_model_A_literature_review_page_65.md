It is easy to see from Table 4 that there are very mature publicly available datasets in anomaly detection of log, image, video, and time series data, which are used by a wide range of researchers, such as log datasets BGL, Thunderbird, spirit, HDFS, OpenStack, etc., image datasets MNIST, MVTecAD, CIFAR, etc., video datasets CUHK, UCSD, etc., time series datasets SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, WADI, NAB, etc. Using these kind of general datasets, researchers can quickly and intuitively compare the performance with other scientific research results. However, in other application scenarios, such as medical and ADS fields, researchers encounter diverse datasets that are challenging to uniformly quantify. This paper suggests that research scholars should

try to make the datasets publicly available for easier access and performance comparison by other scholars. For example, the work by Jin et al. [96] provides a high-quality test dataset for the task of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) video anomaly detection. In addition, due to the high dependence of Transformer models on the quantity and quality of data, relevant research also needs to consider the 'data hungry' [100] problem during model training, such as modifying the model structure or proposing new bias functions.
