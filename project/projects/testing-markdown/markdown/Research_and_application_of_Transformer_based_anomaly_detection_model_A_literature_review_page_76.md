## 7.3.4 More efficient unsupervised binary classification anomaly detection and semi-supervised / weak-supervised multi-class classification anomaly detection

At present, most of Transformer's existing research in the field of anomaly detection is supervised multi-class classification anomaly detection and unsupervised binary classification anomaly detection. Relevant studies of various anomaly detection are shown in Figure 11:

As can be seen from Figure 11, there are basically no unsupervised multi-class classification anomaly detection methods. In this paper, we believe that researchers should strive to improve the performance of unsupervised binary classification anomaly detection tasks, such as enhancing the training efficiency of Transformer, improving input
