## Dynamic Distinction Learning: Adaptive Pseudo Anomalies for Video Anomaly Detection

Supplementary Material

## 7.1. Dynamics of Anomaly Weight σ ( ℓ ) in Model Training (Methodology Supplementary)

To delve deeper into the dynamics of our model's training, it is imperative to scrutinize the behavior of the anomaly weight σ ( ℓ ) , which serves as a crucial variable in the generation of pseudo-anomalous frames. This parameter, σ ( ℓ ) , is not merely a static coefficient but a dynamic element that evolves during the training process, reflecting the model's progressing ability to discern between normal and anomalous instances.

As training progresses, the trend in the anomaly weight σ ( ℓ ) reflects the model's adaptation and learning curve. Initially, σ ( ℓ ) may experience fluctuations, including a rapid increase as the model begins to differentiate between normal and anomalous patterns - as it has in Figure 5 when training the C3DSU model on the Ped2 Dataset. This early rise in σ ( ℓ ) is crucial as it indicates the model's initial phase of learning to handle more pronounced anomalies. As the model's ability to reconstruct and identify anomalies improves, we observe a subsequent decline and eventual stabilization of σ ( ℓ ) , suggesting that the model is settling on an optimal threshold for anomaly detection without being overly influenced by the injected noise levels.
