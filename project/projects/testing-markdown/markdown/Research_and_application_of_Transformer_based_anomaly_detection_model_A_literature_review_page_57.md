NMI (Ω , C ) = I (Ω; C ) ( H (Ω) + H ( C )) / 2 (47)

Where I represents mutual information and H represents entropy. Adjusted Rand Index ( ARI ) is a kind of correction to the RI index. ARI is calculated according to the contingency table. The calculation equation is:

Adjusted Index ︷︸︸︷ ARI = Index ︷ ︸︸ ︷ ∑ ij ( n ij 2 ) -Expected Index ︷ ︸︸ ︷ [ ∑ i ( a i 2 ) ∑ j ( b j 2 ) ] / ( n 2 ) 1 2 [ ∑ i ( a i 2 ) + ∑ j ( b j 2 ) ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸ Max Index -[ ∑ i ( a i 2 ) ∑ j ( b j 2 ) ] / ( n 2 ) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ Expected Index (48)

Zhou et al. [117] additionally used the FAR 95 evaluation index. The calculation equation of the FAR index is as follows:

FAR = FP FP + TN (49)
