The author defined the calculation method of alarm precision as:

P = 1 ˆ S ˆ S ∑ j =1 1 { = } T j ∈ ⋃ [ τ i , τ i + δ max ] (56)

The author argued that their matrix focuses on detecting the real anomaly sequence compared with the instance-based accuracy measurement, therefore it only focuses on accurately detecting the occurrence of anomalous events. If an alarm is raised between the start of the alarm, it is considered a false alarm. Where 1 { . } represents an indicating function, ˆ S = |{ T j }| indicates the number of all alarms, | . | denotes the cardinality of the collection.
