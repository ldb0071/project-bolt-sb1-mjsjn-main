FPR = FP FP + TN (37)

ACC = TP + TN TP + FP + FN + TN (38)

AUC = S 0 -M × ( N +1) / 2 M × N (39)

Where S 0 = ∑ r i . TP , FN , FP , and TN are the number of True Positive, False Negative, False Positive, and True Negative respectively. ROC is a probability curve, and AUC value represents the degree and measure of separability. M,N denotes the number of positive and negative examples respectively, and r i represents the ranking of the i th positive example in the ranking score list [154]. If the AUC value of a model is close to 1, it indicates that the model has excellent separability measurement performance. Table 3 shows the evaluation indexes used by part of Transformer based anomaly detection models:
