Fig. 5. The object-specific decoder reconstructs the anomalous images (left) into anomaly-free images (right) with remarkable fidelity. In the second example, it even correctly reconstructs the anomalous green wire into blue.

## 3.4 Anomaly detection module

The purpose of the anomaly detection module is to localize the anomaly by inspecting the input image reconstruction generated by the general object appearance decoder ( I gen ) and the object-specific appearance decoder ( I spc ). The reconstructed images are concatenated depth-wise and decoded into a segmentation mask M by a Unet-based architecture. M is the output anomaly map indicating the pixel-level location of the anomalies in the image. To compute also the image-level anomaly score, we apply a simple segmentation mask interpretation procedure as in [22] - the segmentation mask is smoothed by a 21 Ã— 21 averaging filter and globally max-pooled into a single score.
