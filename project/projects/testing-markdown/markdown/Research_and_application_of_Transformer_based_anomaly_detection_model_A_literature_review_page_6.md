including dos attacks, worms, backdoors, etc. Experiments show that the supervised paradigm of GTF can improve the robustness of handling class imbalance data. Similar theories and ideas also appear in the work of Xu et al [33]. CATLog [34] introduced a contrastive learning approach to generate embedding layer perturbations based on the standard supervised learning process, and further enhanced the robustness of the model through entropy enhancement. NeuralLog [35] performed supervised binary anomaly detection on log sequences without using log parsing algorithms. The author argued that although NeuralLog is a supervised method, it can be easily applied to semi-supervised scenarios, by simply using reconstruction loss instead of classification loss.

Stanislav et al. [36] investigated the application of Transformer in OOD detection tasks, considering diverse data patterns. They proposed a two-step approach, beginning with unsupervised pre-training of the model followed by fine-tuning in a supervised setting. Their method surpasses previous SOTA models in OOD benchmark tests, demonstrating its efficacy. OODformer [37], uses ViT with DeiT [38] to detect the OOD problem of image multi-class classification tasks in a supervised manner. Yu et al. [39] used marked data from private power grids and trained BERT model to detect Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) attack sequences for the industrial Internet. Similar to OODformer, they also carried out the multi-class classification detection task by classifying simulated attacks into five categories (Normal, Detection, DOS, U2R and R2L), feeding the data into a pre-trained BERT model to extract feature representations related to APT attacks, followed by multi-class classification training

through a Softmax classifier. SwissLog [40] is also a supervised binary log anomaly detection model, which combines semantic embedding and temporal embedding to detect faults resulting in sequence order changes as sequential log anomalies and time interval changes as performance issues. Guo et al. [41] used the stacked Informer [42] to extract underlying features of long time series data in a supervised way, and then replaced the original Adam optimizer with the method of Gradient Centralized (GC) + optimizer for anomaly detection of power line tripping faults.

In general, supervised methods have higher application value in multi-class classification anomaly detection tasks. Moreover, it can be seen from related works that supervised approaches are also gradually merging with unsupervised and semi-supervised paradigms toward universality and robustness.
