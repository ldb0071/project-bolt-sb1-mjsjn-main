At present, the mainstream evaluation indexes in the field of anomaly detection are Precision , Recall , TPR , FPR , F 1 score, and AUCROC (The F 1-score and the area under the curve ( AUC ) of the receiver operating characteristics( ROC ) [153]). Each index is defined as follows:

precision = TP TP + FP (33)

recall = TP TP + FN (34)

F 1 = 2 × precision × recall precision + recall (35)

TPR = TP TP + FN (36)
