## SequenceDetectionDelay :

given τ i as the start time of anomaly event i , T i ≥ τ i as the alarm time, the author defined the average detection delay as:

ADD = 1 S S ∑ i =1 ( T i -τ i ) (55)

Where S represents the number of anomalous events. The author argued that since most anomalies indicate a series of events, it is critical to detect anomaly events within a specific period. The author additionally defined the maximum tolerable delay δ max .
