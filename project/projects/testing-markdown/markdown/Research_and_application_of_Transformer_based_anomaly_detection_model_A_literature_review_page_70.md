## Data imbalance.

Most anomaly detection datasets contain a large number of normal samples and a very small number of abnormal samples, while there is also an imbalance in the internal distribution of most positive samples. Therefore, for the anomaly detection model, it is necessary to learn not only the appropriate representation from the training data but also the prior inductive deviation according to more reasonable constraints.

## The interpretability of the model.
