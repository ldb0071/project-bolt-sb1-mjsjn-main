The structural design of Set Transformer lacks universality and the model generalization ability is weak, so there are few related studies. Tajiri et al. [50] used the Set Transformer's permutation equivariant feature to effectively detect faults in ICT systems. Set Transformer can effectively handle records with missing values without interpolation, as well as variable-length records.

## 4.10 Anomaly detection based on BERT and its variants

BERT [15] is arguably one of the most important and widely used models since the introduction of Transformer. Based on BERT, many subdivision variants, such as RoBERTa [106], have been generated for different downstream tasks. BERT, which
