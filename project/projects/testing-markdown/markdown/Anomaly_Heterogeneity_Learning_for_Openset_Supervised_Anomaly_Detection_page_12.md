MVTec AD [5] is a widely-used dataset that enables researchers to benchmark the performance of anomaly detection methods in the context of industrial inspection applications. The dataset includes over 5,000 images that are divided into 15 object and texture categories. Each category contains a training set of anomaly-free images, as well as a test set that includes images with both defects and defectfree images.

AITEX [42] is a textile fabric database that comprises 245 images of 7 different fabrics, including 140 defect-free images (20 for each type of fabric) and 105 images with various types of defects.

SDD [44] is a collection of images captured in a controlled industrial environment, using defective production items as the subject. The dataset includes 52 images with visible defects and 347 product images without any defects.

ELPV [13] is a collection of 2,624 high-resolution grayscale images of solar cells extracted from photovoltaic modules. These images were extracted from 44 different solar modules, and include both intrinsic and extrinsic defects known to reduce the power efficiency of solar modules.

Optical [50] is a synthetic dataset created to simulate realworld industrial inspection tasks for defect detection. The dataset comprises ten individual subsets, with the first six subsets (referred to as development datasets) intended for algorithm development purposes. The remaining four subsets (known as competition datasets) can be used to evaluate algorithm performance.

Mastcam [20] is a novelty detection dataset constructed from geological images captured by a multispectral imaging system installed on Mars exploration rovers. The dataset comprises typical images as well as images of 11 novel geologic classes. Each image includes a shorter wavelength (color) channel and a longer wavelengths (grayscale) channel.

BrainMRI [40] is a dataset for brain tumor detection obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.

HeadCT [40] is a dataset consisting of 100 normal head CT slices and 100 slices with brain hemorrhage, without distinction between the types of hemorrhage. Each slice is from a different person, providing a diverse set of images for researchers to develop and test algorithms for hemorrhage detection and classification in medical imaging applications.

Hyper-Kvasir [7] is a large-scale open gastrointestinal dataset which is collected during real gastro- and colonoscopy procedures. It is comprised of four distinct parts, including labeled image data, unlabeled image data, segmented image data, and annotated video data.
