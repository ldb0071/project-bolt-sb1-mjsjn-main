There are no instances in the sample set where another LLM revises or checks the output of the LLM. Most sample applications do not check or revise the LLM's output, though several of them parse and transform it. The purpose of the Output Revision dimension is to indicate whether the application includes control or correction mechanisms, rather than just parsing it.

Output Consumer addresses the way of utilizing the LLM output:

User signifies that the LLM output is presented to a human user. E.g., the text output of TruckPlatoon is intended for humans, as well as the output of MyCrunchGPT DomainExpert .

LLM indicates that the output serves as a prompt part in a further LLM invocation. E.g., the knowledge base entries generated by an AutoDroid MemoryGenerator become part of the prompt for AutoDroid TaskExecutor ; the plan output by LowCode Planning serves as a part of the prompt for LowCode Executing .

Program describes instances where the LLM output is consumed and processed further by a software component of the application. E.g., the output of MatrixProduction Manager is handled by software systems (including a Manufacturing Execution System) which use it to compute prompts for other LLM components.

Engine covers scenarios where the LLM output is intended for execution on a runtime engine. E.g., the SQL query generated by SgpTod DstPrompter is

processed by a SQL interpreter; a part of the output of MatrixProduction Operator is executed by automation modules.

Although applications may parse and transform the LLM output before use, the Output Consumer dimension is meant to identify the ultimate consumer, such as an execution engine, rather than an intermediary parser or transformation code. When applications divide the LLM output into parts for different consumers, users applying the taxonomy need to determine which consumer is most relevant, since this dimension is designed to be mutually exclusive.
