## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted various sectors of economy and society [47]. Due to their proficiency in text understanding, creative work, communication, knowledge work, and code writing, they have been adopted in numerous

fields, such as medicine, law, marketing, education, human resources, etc.

Public discussions often focus on the ethical aspects and societal consequences of these systems [36, 39]. Meanwhile, research investigates Artificial General Intelligences and autonomous AI agents that can use services, data sources, and other tools, and collabo-

rate to solve complex tasks [11, 62, 57, 21]. In addi-

tion, LLMs offer many opportunities to enhance software systems. They enable natural language interaction [59], automate complex tasks [19], and provide supportive collaboration, as seen with recent LLMbased assistant products often branded as 'copilots' 1 . This paper addresses the potential of LLMs for software development by integrating their capabilities as components into software systems. This contrasts with current software engineering research, which views LLMs as tools for software development rather than as software components [14, 22], and with the considerable body of research examining LLMs as au-

tonomous agents within multiagent systems [21].

Software systems that invoke an LLM and process its output are referred to as 'LLM-integrated applications', 'LLM-integrated systems', 'LLM-based applications', etc. [32, 13, 57]. LLMs are versatile, multipurpose tools capable of providing functionalities that would otherwise be unfeasible or require substantial development efforts [15, 24]. By significantly expediting system development, they have the potential to revolutionize not only the way users interact with technology, but also the fundamental processes of software development.
