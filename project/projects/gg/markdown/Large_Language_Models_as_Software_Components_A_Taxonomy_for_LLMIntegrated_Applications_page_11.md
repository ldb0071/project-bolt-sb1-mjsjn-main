ExcelCopilot is accessible in a task bar alongside the Excel worksheet. It features buttons with context-dependent suggestions of actions and a text box for users to type in commands in natural language. ExcelCopilot only works with data tables, so its initial suggestion is to convert the active worksheet's data into a data table. Copilot functions activate when a data table or part of it is selected. It then presents buttons for four top-level tasks: 'add formula columns', 'highlight', 'sort and filter', and 'analyze'. The 'analyze' button triggers the copilot to display more buttons, e.g., one that generates a pivot chart from the selected data. ExcelCopilot can also add a formula column to the data table and explain the formula in plain language.

When a user inputs a free-text command, ExcelCopilot may communicate its inability to fulfill it. This constantly occurs with commands requiring multiple steps, indicating that ExcelCopilot lacks a planning LLM component as seen in, for example, MatrixProduction . This observation, along with its mention in [44], suggests that ExcelCopilot employs an intent detection-skill routing architecture. This architecture includes an LLM component that maps free-text user commands to potential intents and then delegates to other LLM components tasked with generating actions to fulfill those intents. Ac-

cordingly, ExcelCopilot comprises several types of LLM components:

- 路 Several distinct Action Executor s generate code for specific application actions, such as creating a pivot table, designing a worksheet formula, inserting a diagram, and so on.
- 路 An Advisor suggests meaningful next actions. Its outputs serve to derive button captions and prompts for ActionExecutor s.
- 路 When a user inputs a free-text command, the IntentDetector is invoked to determine and trigger a suitable ActionExecutor . The IntentDetector communicates its actions to users and informs them when it cannot devise a suitable action.
- 路 The Explainer generates natural language explanations of formulae designed by ExcelCopilot . It is unclear whether under the hood, the ActionExecutor is generating both the formula and the explanation, or if two separate LLM components are being invoked. We assume the latter, i.e., that a separate Explainer LLM component exists.

While users interact repeatedly with ExcelCopilot , each interaction adheres to a single-turn pattern, with the user providing a command and ExcelCopilot executing it [44].

## 5. A Taxonomy for LLM Components and LLM-Integrated Applications

When developing the taxonomy, it emerged that analyzing an LLM-integrated application should begin with identifying and describing its distinct LLM components. Analyzing each LLM component separately helps capture details and provides a clear understanding of how the application utilizes LLM capabilities. The LLM-integrated application can then be described as a combination of the LLM components it employs.

Table 2: Dimensions and characteristics of the taxonomy. Codes of characteristics are printed in uppercase. 'Meta' means 'metadimension'. 'MuEx' means 'mutual exclusiveness'.
