FreeText : unstructured natural language text output. E.g., TruckPlatoon and MyCrunchGpt DomainExpert generate text output in natural language; MatrixProduction Manager and MatrixProduction Operator produce FreeText explanations complementing output in custom formats to be parsed by the application.

Item : a single text item from a predefined set of items, such as a class in a classification task. E.g., ProgPrompt ScenarioFeedback outputs either True or False .

Code : source code or other highly formalized output that the LLM has learned during its training, such as a programming language, XML, or JSON. E.g., AutoDroid TaskExecutor produces code to steer an Android app; MyCrunchGpt SettingsEditor outputs JSON.

Structure : structured, formalized output adhering to a custom format. E.g., LowCode Planning outputs text in a format that can be displayed as a flow chart; MatrixProduction Manager and Operator produce output in custom formats combined with FreeText explanations.

Output Revision indicates whether the application checks or revises the LLM-generated output before

utilization. These characteristics and their interpretations mirror those in the Prompt Check dimension: none : There is no revision of the LLM output.

User : The user revises the LLM output. E.g., the user improves the plan generated by LowCode Planning .

LLM : A further LLM component checks or revises the output of the LLM component under consideration.

Program : Programmed code checks or revises the LLM output. E.g., Honeycomb QueryAssistant corrects the query produced by the LLM before executing it [7].
