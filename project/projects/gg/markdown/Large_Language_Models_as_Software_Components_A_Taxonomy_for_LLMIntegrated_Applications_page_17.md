stances.

User : The user phrases the prompt part. E.g., the Task for ExcelCopilot IntentDetector or for LowCode Planning is phrased by the user. There are no sample instances where the user provides the Instruction or State prompt parts.

LLM : The prompt part is generated by an LLM. E.g., LowCode Planning generates the State for LowCode Executing and ExcelCopilot IntentDetector generates the Task for ExcelCopilot ActionExecutor s.

Program : Application code generates the prompt part. E.g., AutoDroid programmatically generates the State and the Task parts for its MemoryGenerator s in the knowledge base building phase.

The Prompt Instruction dimension is always generated by Program . While a user and possibly an LLM have defined this prompt part during application development, this falls outside the scope of this taxonomy. Therefore, the Prompt Instruction dimension is not discriminating and categorizes all cases as Program . It is retained in the taxonomy for completeness and better understandability.

Prompt Check describes whether the application employs a review mechanism to control and modify the prompt before invoking the LLM. The same characteristics as for the prompt parts are applicable:

none : The prompt is used without check.

User : The user checks and revises the prompt.

LLM : Another LLM component checks or revises the prompt.
