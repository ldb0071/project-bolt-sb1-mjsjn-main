Significance Test Statistics for Spatial Nonstationarity: To test whether the relationship has significant spatial non-stationarity, we use the residual sum of squares and its approximated distribution deduced by Leung i.e. [16] and Wu [33], for significance tests of GNNWR and GWR modeling results.

Firstly, express the hat matrix of GNNWR as:

S GNNWR glyph[defines]      x T 1 W ( u 1 , v 1 )( X T X ) -1 X T x T 2 W ( u 2 , v 2 )( X T X ) -1 X T . . . x T n W ( u n , v n )( X T X ) -1 X T     

δ i glyph[defines] tr { [( I -S ) T ( I -S )] i } , i = 1 , 2 · · ·

The statistical quantities F 1 is obtained as:

F 1 = RSS GNNWR /δ 1 RSS OLR / ( n -p -1)

The distribution of F 1 can be approximated as F distribution /uniFF0C where δ 2 1 δ 2 is the degree of freedom of the numerator and n -p -1 is the degree of freedom of the denominator. That is, given a significance level α , if the inequality F 1 < F 1 -α ( δ 2 1 δ 2 , n -p -1) holds, it can be determined that the regression relationship has significant spatial non-smoothness, otherwise the spatial non-smoothness is not significant.

Second, the significance of the spatial nonstationarity can also be checked for each independent variable one by one. The null hypothesis here is that the weight of this independent variable is the same everywhere in the space. The alternative hypothesis is that the weight of this independent variable differs in at least one place in each part of the space. First, define the variance of the weight of the kth independent variable over the n data points.

V 2 k glyph[defines] 1 n n ∑ i =1 ( ̂ β ik -1 n n ∑ i =1 ̂ β ik ) 2

Define e k as a n-rank vector with the ( k + 1) th element having value 1 and other having value 0. Define as a square matrix of order n with each element having value 1.

B k glyph[defines]      e T k W ( u 1 , v 1 )( X T X ) -1 X T e T k W ( u 2 , v 2 )( X T X ) -1 X T . . . e T k W ( u n , v n )( X T X ) -1 X T     

γ ik glyph[defines] tr { [ 1 n B T k ( I -1 n J ) B k ] i } , i = 1 , 2 · · ·

The statistical quantities F 2 is obtained as:

F 2 ( k ) = V 2 k /γ 1 k σ 2

̂

The distribution of F 2 ( k ) can be approximated as F distribution, where ̂ σ 2 is the mean square error, γ 2 1 k γ 2 k is the degree of freedom of the numerator and δ 2 1 δ 2 is the degree of freedom of the denominator. That is, given a significance level α , if the inequality F 2 ( k ) > F α ( γ 2 1 k γ 2 k , δ 2 1 δ 2 ) holds, the null hypothesis can be rejected and the variable k is determined to have significant spatial non-stationarity, otherwise the spatial non-stationarity is not significant.

Indicators of Model Performance: The paper uses the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. First in the AICc guidelines, the correction of Akaike information criteria ( AIC c ) [10] is as follows:

AIC c = nln ( ̂ σ 2 ) + nln (2 π ) + n n + tr ( S ) n -2 -tr ( S )

The method is applicable for both GWR and GNNWR. In practice, the smaller the value, the better [11], and we use AIC c to select the appropriate input parameters for the GWR model. Other measures of model performance include: coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The definitions are as follows:

R 2 = 1 -∑ n i =1 ( y i -̂ y i ) 2 ∑ n i =1 ( y i -y i ) 2 RMSE = √ ∑ n i =1 ( y i -̂ y i ) 2 n n

n n

MAE = ∑ i =1 | y i -̂ y i |

MAPE = 1 n ∑ i =1 | y i -̂ y i y i | × 100%

Among them, y is the average of the observed values; ̂ σ 2 is the mean square error of the model and p is the effective degree of freedom of the model.
