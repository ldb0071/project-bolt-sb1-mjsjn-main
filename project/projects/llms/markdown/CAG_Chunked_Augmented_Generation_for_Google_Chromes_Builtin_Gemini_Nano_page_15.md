## 5.2 Smart Content Evolution Through Multiple Stages

CAG processes content through multiple refinement stages, similar to having a team of specialized editors review your document in sequence. Each processing stage focuses on different aspects of the content, building upon previous improvements. For instance, when developing a technical manual, the first pass organizes the basic structure and information flow. Subsequent passes add technical details, enhance explanations with examples, and ensure consistency across all sections. This sophisticated processing is achieved through CAG's recursive generation strategy, where each iteration can be configured with specific objectives through dynamic prompting. The system maintains contextual awareness across iterations while efficiently managing browser resources, ensuring stable performance even during complex multi-stage processing tasks. Picture having an AI editor that can transform your content through multiple refinement stages, each time focusing on a different aspect - like having a team of specialized editors working in sequence, but all within your browser.
