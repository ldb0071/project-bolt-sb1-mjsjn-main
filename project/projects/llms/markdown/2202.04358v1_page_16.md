## 4.2 Analysis of Each Variable on House Prices

The GNNWR model is based on the structure of linear regression, where different weights are assigned to different variables based on the location of the prop-

erty to capture spatial heterogeneity. For the ten-fold dataset obtained in this study, the weights of different independent variables at each prediction point can be visualized and output after merging the validation sets among them. This section focuses on the analysis of the significance of these weights.

Since the data are pre-normalized when they enter GNNWR training, the values here can be compared directly in Table 10. As can be seen from the mean values, the degree to which each independent variable affects house prices is different, and after taking the absolute values, they are SD, MF, AB, NPS, DSS, GR, NSS, QASP and PR, from the highest to the lowest. After accounting for spatial heterogeneity, the effect of NPS and AB on house prices is larger than that estimated using the correlation coefficient, and the effect of NSS on house prices is smaller than that estimated using the correlation coefficient. However, the positive and negative correlations of house prices are not violated, still MF, NPS, GR, NSS, QASP, PR are positively correlated with house prices and SD, AB, DSS are negatively correlated with house prices. The standard deviations of these weights were compared, from highest to lowest, as DSS, MF, SD, AB, NSS, NPS, GR, PR, and QASP. That is, public transportation conditions represented by DSS have greater spatial heterogeneity and school district conditions represented by QASP have less spatial heterogeneity, which is in line with the majority ' s intuition. It can be speculated that since the value of quality educational resources is similar for residents in all parts of the city, the school district factor contributes to house prices with a more stable weight in all parts of Shenzhen. It can also be presumed that the distance to the subway station is not so important for residences living in the CBD or closely nearby the subway entrances. However, in the ordinary residential areas of the city and suburbs lacking wealthy people, the distance to the subway station is quite important. In-depth analysis requires specific distributions about the weights of each variable, as shown by Figure a-z. These figures are based on the natural breakpoint method with inconsistent color ranges for different subplots, and the boundaries around 0 are fine-tuned to show positive and negative correlation features. Due to the small standard deviation, the data of PR and QASP were classified into 6 levels only, while all other variables were classified into 8 levels. Overall, the modeling results based on ten different training sets are smooth, with few mutations and outliers in geographic proximity. They are quite consistent when making predictions for the weight distribution.
