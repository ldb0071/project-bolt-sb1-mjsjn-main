## 3.2 Browser-Based AI Processing

Integrating AI capabilities directly into web browsers represents an emerging field with unique constraints and opportunities. Chrome's implementation of Gemini Nano (Google, 2024) marks a significant milestone in bringing local AI processing to browsers, though with inherent context limitations due to browser resource constraints. Previous work in browser-based machine learning primarily focused on inference optimization through WebGL and WebAssembly (Rivard & Viswanatha, 2024), providing foundational techniques for efficient model execution within browser environments.

The challenges of managing large-scale processing within browser constraints have been addressed in various ways. WebAssembly-based approaches have demonstrated the viability of complex computational tasks within browsers while maintaining reasonable memory footprints (How to run Gemini Nano locally in your browser, 2024). These implementations inform our approach to resource management and chunk-processing strategies.
