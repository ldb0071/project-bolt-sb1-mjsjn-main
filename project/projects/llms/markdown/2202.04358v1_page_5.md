The total number of complete and effective initial data records obtained in this study is 2871, covering 2871 residential quarters in Shenzhen. The specific data source is https://shenzhen.qfang.com/ . In this study, it is divided into the following three categories according to its functions:

- 1. Latitude and longitude of the property: The data crawled by this property are latitude between 22.484310 N and 22.788011 N and longitude between 113.814605 E and 114.498340 E. The latitude and longitude coordinates used for GNNWR were converted to WGS 1984 50N coordinate system after projection conversion.
- 2. Endogenous Variable of the property: age of building (AB), number of parking spots (NPS), management fee (MF), number of buildings (NB), green ratio (GR), plot ratio (PR). The house age is calculated according to 2021 minus the construction age. If the construction age is a rage, the completion time is taken. If the

property fee is a range, it shall be calculated according to the average value of the upper and lower bounds. Greening rate and plot ratio are defined as follows:

GR = S V egetation S Total

PR = S Total Floor S Land Area

- 3. Environment related variables: sea distance (SD), quality of available public schools (QAPS), number of subway stations within 1 km radius (NSS), distance to the nearest subway station (DSS). Where SD is calculated by taking the position to the nearest coast nearby, with DSS units in meters. QAPS is calculated as following method: we divide schools into 4 types, including provincial key schools, city key schools, district key schools and ordinary schools. We give different points for different schools: 1 point for ordinary junior high school, 2 points for district key junior high school, 3 points for city key junior high school, 4 points for provincial key junior high school, 1.5 points for ordinary elementary school, 2.5 points for district key elementary school, 3.5 points for city key elementary school, and 4.5 points for provincial key elementary school. Finally, the points of the best school in a school district will be taken as QASP.
