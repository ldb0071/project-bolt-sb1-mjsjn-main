## 4.2.2 Analysis of Endogenous Variable

The property endogenous variables used in this model are MF, AB, NPS, GR and PR, in descending order of influence.

Table 10: Descriptive Statistics of Weights of Variables

| Weight of Variables   |     AB |    NPS |     MF |     GR |     PR |     SD |   QASP |    NSS |    DSS |   Intercept |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Mean                  | -0.28  |  0.17  |  0.458 |  0.114 |  0.002 | -0.474 |  0.021 |  0.033 | -0.16  |       0.508 |
| Maximum               |  0.612 |  1.101 |  2.675 |  0.836 |  0.32  |  0.383 |  0.179 |  0.701 |  6.763 |       1.486 |
| Minimum               | -1.45  | -0.42  | -1.322 | -0.23  | -0.191 | -2.035 | -0.055 | -0.868 | -4.627 |      -0.018 |
| Std. Dev.             |  0.195 |  0.179 |  0.609 |  0.108 |  0.057 |  0.253 |  0.026 |  0.187 |  0.82  |       0.208 |

House prices are mainly positively correlated with MF, typical areas include the southwest of Nanshan District, the southern coast of Baoan District, etc. Negatively correlated areas include Huanggang, in Futian District along the border with Hong Kong. We speculate that marginal districts may have a stronger positive correlation between management fees and house prices.

The growth of AB has had a restraining effect on house prices in Shenzhen for the most part. The negative correlation between house prices and AB is strongest in the coastal Nanshan District with Houhai as the core, the central Futian District with Xiangmi Lake's eastern shore as the core, and the southern Longhua District with Shenzhen North Station as the core. This may be due to the large supply of quality new houses near these locations, and the relatively old properties are vulnerable to the cold market. At

the border of Luohu and Futian districts, the effect of AB on house prices shifts from a negative to a rare positive correlation, i.e. properties here do not have discounts due to old age, but may instead have premiums. According to the research of Goodman et al., the process by which house age affects house prices is nonlinear, with a positive effect on house prices when the age of the house is greater than a certain threshold. [14] In fact, this area explored by the GNNWR model is exactly the area where the earliest construction in Shenzhen took place, and the famous landmarks Dongmen Old Street and Diwang Building are located near this area.

NPS and house price are basically positively correlated. The strongest positive correlations are found in the central Nanshan District, Xiangmi Park in western Futian District, and near Caiwuwei in Luohu District. It can be speculated that the contribution of NPS to house prices should be most obvious in middle-class residential areas and wealthy areas. The high positive correlation areas explored by the GNNWR model are consistent with the distribution of middle-class residential areas and wealthy areas.

The increase of GR can raise the house price, especially for the central Futian District and the central Luohu District, which are located in the prosperous part of the city with higher demand for GR. In the suburbs and along the coast, GR has a smaller effect on raising house prices, and there is even a subtle negative correlation zone in Longgang District.
