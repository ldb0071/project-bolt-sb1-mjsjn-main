## 3.1 Dataset Analysis and Descriptive Statistics

The results of correlation analysis and descriptive statistics of Shenzhen house prices with the respective variable factors are shown in the Table 3 below.

As can be seen from the table, ranked by the absolute values of the correlation coefficients in descending order, the variables are SD, MF, NSS, DSS, GR, AB, PR, QAPS, NPS. The variables positively correlated with house prices are MF, NSS, GR, PR, QAPS, NPS, and negatively correlated with SD, DSS, AB. The average price of residential housing in Shenzhen sampled in this dataset is 62219 . 33 yuan/m 2 . From the highest 132000 yuan/m 2 to the lowest 16100 yuan/m 2 , the value domain basically covers the reference price of second-hand housing transactions for all residential housing in Shenzhen at present. VIF measures the extent to which this independent variable is influenced by other independent variables, and since all of them are extremely close to 1, it can be found that the degree of multicollinearity of the data source is minimal.

Ranked by coefficient of variation in descending order, the variables are QAPS, Price, GR, AB, PR, MF, NSS, NPS, SD, DSS. After normalization, QAPS is the variable with the greatest difference, while DSS varies the least among properties. In general, the price fluctuation is also relatively large, and the price difference between high-quality and low-quality properties is obvious, which more truly reflects the scarcity and non-renewable nature of land resources.

It should be noted that this study also conducted hypothesis testing for each variable in the global regression equation using R language. For each variable, it is assumed that its coefficient is zero in the global regression equation, and a test statistic that

satisfies the t-distribution when the hypothesis holds can be constructed. Correspondingly, the p-value can be calculated. The p-values of AB, MF, GR, SD, NSS, and DSS will be recorded as 0 because they are less than the accuracy threshold of 2 . 2 × 10 -16 . The p-values of NPS were also very small and highly significant. It can also be found that the p-value of PR is not significant at the significance level of 0.01 and the p-value of QAPS is not significant at the significance level of 0.05 or even 0.1. If a global regression is used, these two independent variables should be excluded. However, two spatial statistical modeling methods, GNNWR and GWR, are used in this study, and the significance of each variable in this model can be retested with the help of the F2 statistic in this paper. According to the analysis of non-stationarity diagnostics in 3.3, both variables are highly significant, when the coefficients of the linear model are allowed to vary with geographic coordinates. This proves the superiority of the spatial statistical modeling approach from another side.
