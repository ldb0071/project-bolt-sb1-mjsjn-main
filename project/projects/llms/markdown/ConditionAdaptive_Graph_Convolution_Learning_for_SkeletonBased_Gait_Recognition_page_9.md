## B. Network Architecture

The two-branch architecture of CAG is illustrated in Fig. 2, where a human skeleton sequence I is taken as an input. In the first branch, based on the viewing conditions and sequence characteristics, VATL dynamically constructs a view-adaptive topology G V A . The constructed G V A is utilized to guide a joint aggregation of graph convolutions in the second branch. Also, a cross-entropy loss L view CE is employed to supervise view-related feature learning.

Fig. 2: Illustration of CAG. A gait skeleton sequence of T frames is taken as an input. The input sequence is passed through two branches; the first branch employs the VATL module to produce a view-adaptive topology for adaptation to camera viewpoints; the second branch extracts customized features using a series of CAG blocks. In each block, the adaptive joint-specific filters are dynamically generated by the JSFL module. Joints relationship pyramid mapping (JRPP) [8] is used to map the gait skeleton features into 6 scales. C in , C out , L CE , L tri and L circle denote the input-channel number, the output-channel number, the cross-entropy loss, the triplet loss [57] and the circle loss [58], respectively. See text for more details.

In the second branch, coarse skeleton features are initially extracted using a lightweight embedding module, i.e., an ordinary GCN block, which is described in Eq. (1). Then, CAG blocks are stacked to refine the features and extract customized clues. In each block, the JSFL module is used to automatically generate filters ( F S and F T ) in a depth-wise manner. In particular, F S combined with G V A from VATL is used for spatial configuration extraction, and F T is used for temporal modeling. Two 1 × 1 convolutions are employed to fuse the cross-channel information.

Consequently, the GCN operations in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) can be rewritten as follows:

X S = Conv 1 × 1 ( K S ∑ k =1 G k V A ( X ⊗ F k S ) , W 1 ) , X T = Conv 1 × 1 ( X S ⊗ F T , W 2 ) , (3)

where ⊗ denotes the depth-wise convolution, G k V A ∈ R N × N , F k S ∈ R N × C , F T ∈ R K T × N × C ' , W 1 ∈ R C × C ' and W 2 ∈ R C ' × C ' .

After processing the CAG blocks, a JRPP [8] module is used to map the gait features into 6 scales based on the joint relationship of human architecture. Finally, a triplet loss [57] L tri and a circle loss [58] L circle are applied on the output features to perform training supervision. The overall loss function is summarized as follows:

L = λ 1 L tri + λ 2 L circle + λ 3 L view CE , (4)

where λ 1 , λ 2 and λ 3 are the hyperparameters to balance the respective loss functions.

Inspired by the two-stream works [20], [59], where fusing joint and bone features enable networks to recognize human activities, we employ two separate streams for individually extracting joint and bone features; the objective is to combine the merits of both. The pipeline of the bone-feature stream is the same as that of the joint-feature stream, except that its input is the subtraction of coordinates in adjacent joints. The jointfeature stream can be regarded as the first-order information, and the bone-feature stream can be regarded as the secondorder information. For simplicity, we only illustrate the jointfeature stream in Fig. 2. Features from the two streams are concatenated with a size of 12 × C out and used as an output.
