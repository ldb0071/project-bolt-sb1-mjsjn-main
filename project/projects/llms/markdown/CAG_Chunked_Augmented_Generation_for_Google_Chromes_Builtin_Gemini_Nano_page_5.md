## 2.2 Browser-Based AI Processing

The evolution of browser-based AI processing represents a significant shift in how artificial intelligence capabilities are delivered to end users. Traditional approaches relied heavily on server-side processing through REST APIs, introducing latency and privacy concerns. The movement toward browser-based processing addresses these limitations while creating new challenges and opportunities for optimization.

Modern browsers have evolved to support sophisticated computational tasks through WebAssembly and Web Workers. These technologies enable parallel processing and near-native performance for complex calculations, making them ideal for AI workloads. Implementing these capabilities has led to the development of specialized memory management techniques that efficiently handle large neural network models within browser constraints.

Browser-based AI processing also benefits from the increasing availability of hardware acceleration through WebGL and WebGPU APIs. These interfaces enable AI models to leverage GPU capabilities directly through the browser, significantly improving processing speed for certain operations. However,

this approach requires careful optimization to handle the varying capabilities of different devices and browsers, necessitating robust fallback mechanisms and adaptive processing strategies.
