## A. Tasks Introduction

Recently, LLMs have been shown to possess extensive common sense and powerful semantic understanding capabilities, fundamentally transforming the existing workflow for processing text. However, whether LLMs can effectively handle graph learning tasks, transferring their generalization ability from text tasks to graph learning tasks, such as node and graph classification, is still a research subject that needs

exploring. These tasks require the model to learn and solve graph learning tasks, as shown in Figure 8. In this section, we present seven graph learning tasks along with their definitions. Next, we introduce graph learning methods, categorized into three types based on the role of LLMs: LLMs act as enhancers, LLMs act as predictors, and graph prompts.

- 1) Node classification: The node classification task requires LLM to learn based on the neighbors of a node or the attributes of a node. It involves classifying unseen nodes in a given graph, such as categorizing papers in an academic network into different research directions, as shown in Figure 8 (a).
- 2) Graph classification: The graph classification task requires LLM to classify the entire graph. LLM is given several labeled graphs and is expected to classify unseen graphs. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a graph, and LLM can predict the properties or functions of the molecule by classifying the graph, as shown in Figure 8 (b).
- 3) Edge classification: The edge classification task involves classifying the edges in a graph. Existing methods improve edge classification by training a learnable graph prompt and combining it with a GNN or LLM, as shown in Figure 8 (c).
- 4) Node generation: The node generation task refers to providing requirements for an LLM to generate nodes, allowing it to generate node attributes, which are then added to the TAG to enhance it.
- 5) Knowledge graph question qnswering (KGQA): Knowledge graph organizes data into a structured format, representing entities, properties, and relationships. Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to capture the most appropriate answers by querying the knowledge graph (KG) using natural language questions. This task evaluates the ability of LLM to reason and understand the underlying graph structure to provide accurate answers, as shown in Figure 8 (d).
- 6) Graph query language (GQL) generation: The graph query language generation task involves generating graph
