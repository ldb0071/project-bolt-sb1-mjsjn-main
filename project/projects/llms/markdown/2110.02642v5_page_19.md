## C MORE SHOWCASES

To obtain an intuitive comparison of main results (Table 1), we visualize the criterion of various baselines. Anomaly Transformer can present the most distinguishable criterion (Figure 8). Besides,

for the real-world dataset, Anomaly Transformer can also detect the anomalies correctly. Especially for the SWaT dataset (Figure 9(d)), our model can detect the anomalies in the early stage, which is meaningful for real-world applications, such as the early warning of malfunctions.

Figure 8: Visualization of learned criterion for the NeurIPS-TS dataset. Anomalies are labeled by red circles and red segments (first row). The failure cases of the baselines are bounded by red boxes.

Figure 9: Visualization of the model learned criterion in real-world datasets. We select one dimension of the data for visualization. These showcases are from the test set of corresponding datasets.
