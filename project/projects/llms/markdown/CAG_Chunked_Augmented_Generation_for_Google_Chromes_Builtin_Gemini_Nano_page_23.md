## 6.5 Implementation Implications

These benchmarking results have directly influenced CAG's implementation strategies:

- 1. Chunk Size Optimization: The prevalence of medium-length articles led to optimizing chunk boundaries around the 24,576-character mark, maximizing processing efficiency for the most common use case.
- 2. Memory Management: The relatively small number of extra-large and humongous articles allows for more aggressive resource allocation when processing these edge cases without compromising overall browser performance.
- 3. Processing Pipeline: The clear categorization of document sizes enables predictive resource allocation, allowing CAG to anticipate processing requirements and optimize chunk-handling strategies accordingly.

The benchmarking data demonstrates CAG's ability to effectively handle a wide range of input sizes while maintaining consistent performance within Chrome's constraints. The system shows particular efficiency in processing the most common document sizes (small to large categories), while successfully managing the computational challenges presented by larger inputs.
