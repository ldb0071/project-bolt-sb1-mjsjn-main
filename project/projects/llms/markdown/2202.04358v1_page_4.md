## 2.1 Shenzhen House Price Profile

In 1980, Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was established. It is adjacent to Hong Kong in the south, located in the west of the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong Province, China. With its geographical advantages close to Hong Kong and the policy support, Shenzhen has now become the third largest sorted by GDP, with nine districts under its jurisdiction. According to the announcement data of the

Seventh National Census, the population of Shenzhen has reached 17.56 million. Even under the impact of COVID-19, Shenzhen's regional GDP reached 2767.024 billion RMB in 2020, an increase of 3.1% over 2019. [2]

Owing to the increasement of population, with great economic conditions and perfect business environment, the house prices in Shenzhen are also rising. In the short term, affected by the loose liquidity stimulated spurred by the COVID-19, Shenzhen real estate market in 2020 was quite prosperous. The investment in real estate development increased by 16.4% over the previous year; the residential construction area increased by 21%; and the sales area of commercial housing increased by 17.3%, which led to the further rise of house prices as a whole. According to the second-hand housing data of 70 large and mediumsized cities released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2020, Shenzhen's real estate market rose by 14.1% throughout the year. As the only city with an increase of more than 10% in China, it ranked first in the growth rate.

In order to suppress the excessive growth of house prices, in February 2021, Shenzhen Real Estate and Urban Construction Development Research Center formed the reference price of second-hand housing transactions in 3,595 residential quarters, based on the government recorded transaction prices of secondhand housing and the surrounding first-hand housing price. [1]

From the perspective of data modeling, the Shenzhen data were selected for the study mainly due to the following factors. First, the reference price of second-hand housing transactions has itself undergone considerable evaluation compared to other data. It averages out the differences in different house types and floors, and also combines government recorded transaction prices and surrounding first-hand housing prices, removing short-term heat and bubbles and reflecting a relatively accurate valuation result for a property. Secondly, Shenzhen's urban development is more natural. There is no important political center, relics or slums affecting urban planning. Finally, the reference prices are introduced in a uniform batch, with a large amount of data and influence. Modeling of the reference price of second-hand house transactions in Shenzhen can provide reference for more cities to introduce similar measures.
