## 1 Introduction

As one of the countries with the fastest urbanization process, China has steadily rising housing prices in the past decades, especially in its major cities. Affected by the COVID-19 in 2020, the world's major economies entered a liquidity easing cycle, and housing prices in many cities in China rose significantly. [4] On this basis, several Chinese cities, such as Shenzhen, Xi'an, Chengdu, have implemented secondhand housing transaction reference price, which is used to curb housing price rising. The reference price provides us with a reasonable valuation for the housing prices with slightly bubbles.

Housing price is closely related to the life of new urban residents, and it is also an economic index that the government needs to pay close attention to. Exploring the spatial distribution pattern of housing price has great practical significance and guiding value for government regulation, individual house purchase or third-party valuation.

To model and estimate house prices, different models have been developed by many scholars. In

1972, Rosen proposed the Hedonic model, which aims to measure property prices using a number of environmental factors. The early studies mainly consisted of three components: locational traits, structural traits, and neighborhood traits, i.e., residential prices are mainly a function of these three characteristics and are approximately linearly related in an exponentially corrected manner. [8, 27] A number of subsequent studies have demonstrated the relative validity of this model, and measures of these factors are able to estimate more accurately the positive or negative correlation between each independent variable and house prices. For example, HENRY M.K. MOK's modeling of house prices in Hong Kong in 1994 showed that house prices were significantly negatively correlated with the age of the house, distance from the CBD, and significantly positively correlated with the floor. [23] As times progressed, more and more independent variables were taken into account and more statistical indicators were added to test the validity of the model. Further studies have partially incorporated land use planning, and also accessibility in terms of transportation. [5] In recent years, related

residential house price studies have incorporated a variety of external environmental factors such as natural landscape and neighborhood size to analyze the impact on house prices. [13] However, these models have constantly encountered problems in dealing with spatial heterogeneity and spatial non-stationarity, i.e., the same independent variable has different effects on house prices in different regions. Ordinary Hedonic models can only model a certain independent variable with constant coefficients, but the real situation often influenced by spatial factors. For example, in suburban areas, transportation conditions dominate house prices and the quality of nearby schools does not matter. However, in downtown areas, the quality of schools near homes might be more critical and nearby transportation conditions are relatively less important. This is something that cannot be analyzed by ordinary Hedonic models.

Further, taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of the different influencing factors, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) methods are proposed that allow the coefficients to change at different locations. [7,10] The method can be understood as a local weighted linear regression for each local area, and the weights fully take into account the effects of adjacent data points according to the first law of geography proposed by Tobler. [32] In order to build a more satisfying model for the relationships between the house price and the area, Brunsdon and Fotheringham have mentioned several key questions GWR faced: the selection of the variables, bandwidth, and the spatial autocorrelation of error after proposing GWR. [6] Many scholars have made attempts on this basis. For example, in 2011 Jijin Geng et al. had used the GWR model to model house prices in Shenzhen. Compared with the Ordinary Linear Regression (OLR) model, the R square improved from 0.56 to 0.79. [12] Zhang et al. used mixed geographically weighted regression to model the rent in Nanjing, i.e., some variables were locally weighted according to geographical location, while some variables were globally weighted, and good results were achieved. [36] Binbin Lu added non-Euclidean distance to GWR, and for some geographic elements that do not obey the standard linear measure, this model achieves better results on the spatial proximity measure of London and can have better estimation performance for house prices. [19, 20]

However, the ability of GWR to express nonlinear spatial relationships is quite limited. Therefore, many scholars have resorted to artificial intelligence methods, which have developed rapidly in recent years, to model house prices using their superb fitting ability to nonlinear relationships. [17, 29] Although the estimation performance of neural network models is usually superior to that of GWR models, the spatial distributions obtained by these models are not

entirely reasonable and the constructed regression relationships are difficult to interpret spatially, because they ignore the spatial properties of residential price regression relationships.

In recent years, based on the idea of geographic weighting of GWR, Sensen Wu proposed a Geographically Neural Network Weighted Regression (GNNWR) model by combining OLR and neural network models. [9, 33] Based on the powerful learning ability of neural networks, the potential spatial nonstationarity and complex nonlinear features in regression relations can be well handled. In the current study, GNNWR has effectively solved many problems and has performed well in modeling the ecological environment of nearshore seas [34], also showed superior explanatory power in the estimation of spatial PM 2.5 concentrations in China. [37]

On February 8, 2021, the Shenzhen Real Estate and Urban Construction Development Research Center released reference prices for second-hand housing transactions for the city's 3,595 residential quarters. [3] Based on this dataset, a residential price valuation model can be developed, which covers various factors such as property endogenous variables, subway, and school district conditions. This study attempts to build a residential price valuation model with the help of a relatively new tool, GNNWR, in an attempt to deal with the spatial heterogeneity and spatial non-stationarity present in this data. [9]

In summary, this study aims to put the GNNWR model into practice in the socioeconomic field, establish a residential price valuation model based on the reference price data of second-hand housing transactions in Shenzhen, realize the accurate fitting of the spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear relationship of multiple environmental factors in the modeling, and then obtain a more accurate house pricing model than GWR method, with the spatial distribution of multiple factors' influence coefficients. It can provide reference for residential valuation, land auctions, and the reference prices of second-hand housing transactions in other cities.
