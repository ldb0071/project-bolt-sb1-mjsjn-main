Fig 6. Experimental workflow for evaluating CAG (Chunked Augmented Generation) system performance with Chrome's Gemini Nano implementation. The process consists of four main stages: (1) data collection using Wikipedia API, (2) article categorization based on Context Window Length Quotient, (3) processing through Chrome Canary extension, and (4) performance analysis using custom metrics toolkit. Key system components include the core cag-js library, Chrome Extension integration layer, performance analysis tools, and Wikipedia corpus generation utilities.

Results were captured through the Chrome extension's interface, with output being systematically analyzed through the text metrics toolkit to generate comprehensive performance metrics, including compression ratios and ROUGE scores. This setup enabled detailed analysis of CAG's performance across various content lengths and types, providing quantitative measures of both processing efficiency and output quality.

All experimental runs were conducted under controlled conditions to ensure consistency in browser resource availability and processing environment. This methodological approach enabled systematic evaluation of CAG's performance characteristics while maintaining reproducibility across different content categories and processing scenarios.
