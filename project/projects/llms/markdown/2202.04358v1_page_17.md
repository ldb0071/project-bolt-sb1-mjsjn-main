## 4.2.1 Analysis of Intercept Term Distribution

Figure 10: Intercept Distribution

<!-- image -->

The meaning of the intercept term is the inherent premium of the house after considering all the effects from the independent variables. It can be found by the graph that the reference prices for second-hand housing transactions introduced by the government gives the highest inherent premium to the coast of Nanshan District with the Houhai as the core, and the middle of Futian District with the east shore of Xiangmi Lake as the core. Because of the scarcity of premium locations, the market must be more frantic to capture this information and give higher premiums. In 2020, the highest residential transaction price of these two sites at $50,000-$70,000 per square meter continues to set a new record for housing prices in Shenzhen, while the relatively more marginal residences return to $10,000-$20,000. At this level, the reference price from government succeeds in perceiving the inherent premium distribution and narrowing the gap between inherent premiums. The GNNWR model is similarly able to provide an accurate estimate of the premium inherent in each block based on the reference price.
