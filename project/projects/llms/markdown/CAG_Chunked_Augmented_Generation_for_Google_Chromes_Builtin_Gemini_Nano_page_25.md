## 7.1 Experiment Setup

The experimental setup was designed to rigorously evaluate CAG's performance across diverse content types while ensuring reproducibility and statistical validity. The implementation utilized three core components: the cag-js library for core functionality, a custom Chrome extension for Gemini Nano integration, and a specialized text metrics toolkit for performance analysis.

The primary testing environment consisted of a Chrome extension built on the cag-js library, specifically designed to leverage Chrome's built-in AI capabilities for running Gemini Nano. This extension served as the primary interface for content processing and evaluation, enabling direct interaction with the CAG implementation while maintaining consistent browser conditions across all tests.

For systematic evaluation, we developed a comprehensive benchmarking framework using a custom text metrics toolkit. This toolkit served dual purposes: generating standardized datasets for experimentation and providing detailed performance metrics for result analysis. The testing pipeline was structured to ensure consistent evaluation conditions across all content categories while maintaining precise control over experimental variables.

Data corpus generation followed a structured approach utilizing the Wikipedia-JS library to programmatically collect a diverse range of articles. This methodology ensured representation across various topics and content lengths, enabling comprehensive testing across different use cases. The collected articles underwent rigorous categorization based on the Context Window Length Quotient (CWQ), calculated as:
