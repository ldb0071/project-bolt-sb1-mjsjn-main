query languages, including GQL and Cypher, to perform operations on graph databases. Evaluating LLM's ability to generate GQL helps users extract information from the database, as shown in Figure 8 (e).

7) Node feature explanation: Node feature explanation task involves extracting the attributes of nodes in a text attribute graph. For example, in an academic paper network, the node attributes may include abstracts, titles, etc. LLM is expected to provide reasoning for the classification process of nodes based on their text attributes and explain the features of the nodes, as shown in Figure 8 (f).
