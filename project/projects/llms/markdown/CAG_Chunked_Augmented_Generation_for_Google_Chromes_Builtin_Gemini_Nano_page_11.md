## 3.5 Relationship to Existing Context Extension Approaches

CAG's approach differs from existing context extension techniques in several key aspects:

- 1. Browser-Specific Optimization: Unlike server-focused approaches like YARN or Landmark Attention, CAG is specifically designed for browser environments, with careful consideration of memory constraints and processing capabilities.
- 2. Dynamic Resource Management: While other approaches often assume fixed computational resources, CAG actively adapts to varying browser conditions and device capabilities.
- 3. Progressive Processing: Our implementation introduces a novel progressive chunk processing strategy that maintains browser responsiveness while handling large inputs, a consideration not typically addressed in server-side solutions.
- 4. Local Privacy Preservation: CAG's architecture enables the processing of sensitive data entirely within the browser, differentiating it from hybrid approaches that rely on external API calls.

This literature review positions CAG within the broader landscape of context window extension techniques while highlighting its unique contributions to browser-based AI processing. The synthesis of these various research streams enables our approach to effectively address the specific challenges of implementing large-context AI processing within browser constraints.
