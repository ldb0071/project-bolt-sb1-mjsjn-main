## 2.1 UNSUPERVISED TIME SERIES ANOMALY DETECTION

As a vital real-world problem, unsupervised time series anomaly detection has been widely explored. Categorizing by anomaly determination criterion, the paradigms roughly include the densityestimation, clustering-based, reconstruction-based and autoregression-based methods.

As for the density-estimation methods, the classic methods local outlier factor (LOF, Breunig et al. (2000)) and connectivity outlier factor (COF, Tang et al. (2002)) calculates the local density and local connectivity for outlier determination respectively. DAGMM (Zong et al., 2018) and MPPCACD (Yairi et al., 2017) integrate the Gaussian Mixture Model to estimate the density of representations.

In clustering-based methods, the anomaly score is always formalized as the distance to cluster center. SVDD (Tax & Duin, 2004) and Deep SVDD (Ruff et al., 2018) gather the representations from normal data to a compact cluster. THOC (Shen et al., 2020) fuses the multi-scale temporal features from intermediate layers by a hierarchical clustering mechanism and detects the anomalies by the multi-layer distances. ITAD (Shin et al., 2020) conducts the clustering on decomposed tensors.

The reconstruction-based models attempt to detect the anomalies by the reconstruction error. Park et al. (2018) presented the LSTM-VAE model that employed the LSTM backbone for temporal modeling and the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for reconstruction. OmniAnomaly proposed by Su et al. (2019) further extends the LSTM-VAE model with a normalizing flow and uses the reconstruction probabilities for detection. InterFusion from Li et al. (2021) renovates the backbone to a hierarchical VAE to model the inter- and intra- dependency among multiple series simultaneously. GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) are also used for reconstruction-based anomaly detection (Schlegl et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019a; Zhou et al., 2019) and perform as an adversarial regularization.

The autoregression-based models detect the anomalies by the prediction error. VAR extends ARIMA (Anderson & Kendall, 1976) and predicts the future based on the lag-dependent covariance. The autoregressive model can also be replaced by LSTMs (Hundman et al., 2018; Tariq et al., 2019).

This paper is characterized by a new association-based criterion. Different from the random walk and subsequence-based methods (Cheng et al., 2008; Boniol & Palpanas, 2020), our criterion is embodied by a co-design of the temporal models for learning more informative time-point associations.
