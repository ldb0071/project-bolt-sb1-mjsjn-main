## 4.2.3 Analysis of Environment related variables

The environmental variables considered in this model include SD, DSS, NSS, QASP.

Figure 16: SD Weight Distribution

There is a very obvious negative correlation between SD and house prices, and the most typical areas include most of Nanshan District, most of Luohu District, etc. In comparison, the negative impact of SD in suburban and inland areas is slightly smaller, including Pingshan District and Guangming District. We speculate that suburban areas farther from the sea have other natural landscape, such as lakes and forests, which partially compensate for the disadvantage of being farther from the sea. Also, here SD is already quite large, and the absolute value of the coefficient need not be large to fully reflect the weakening effect on house prices. It should be noted in particular that in certain inland parcels, there is also a prominent negative SD correlation, such as the southern part of Longgang District and the northern edge of Luohu District. We believe that this is due to the fact that SD here actually characterizes the distance from the core urban area, thus triggering a strong negative correlation.

The fluctuation of PR is relatively small, and its impact on the house price is not significant from the sight of average weight. However, there is an area with clear positive correlation between PR and house price, the western part of Luohu District. This is contrary to the general perception, and we believe that it is mainly because the plot ratio there is closely related to the overall appearance of the neighborhood. The western part of Luohu District is the older urban area of Shenzhen, and a low plot ratio tends to represent the old and dilapidated character of the neighborhood, while a high plot ratio tends to be able to correspond to new high-rise housing. Probably for this reason, a positive correlation area appears here, while in other locations it does not.

The correlation between DSS and house price fluc-

tuates very much. Generally, further away from the subway means lower house price. The regions showing negative correlation include most of the suburbs, especially the southern part of Baoan District and the southern part of Longhua District. In the main urban area, the western part of Luohu District, the central part of Futian District, and the central part of Nanshan District have significant negative correlation between house price and DSS.

However, the areas where DSS is positively correlated are the southeastern part of Futian District, the southern part of Luohu District, and the southern part of Nanshan District. After inspection, a large number of jobs are concentrated in these areas. Southeastern part of Futian District corresponds to the Huaqiang North Market, one of the biggest Cell phone parts distribution markets around the world. The southern part of Luohu District corresponds to Xinxiu Village Industrial Zone. The southern part of Nanshan District corresponds to the area around Shekou Industrial Zone.

From this we have the following inference. On the one hand, for somewhere like residential areas and suburban areas, the closer to the subway entrance, the more convenient the commuting will be, and the price of housing will naturally have a certain increase. On the other hand, directly above the subway entrance, too much movement of people and underground vibration of the subway may have a negative impact on the price of housing. Moreover, for areas with dense subway entrances, CBD or industrial areas, being too close to the subway entrances may have a negative impact on house prices. People who buy houses in this neighborhood are already close to their workplace, and the need to commute with the help of the subway is insignificant; being too close to the subway entrance will instead aggravate the noise and congestion.

The relationship between NSS and house price is that the more subway entrances there are, the higher the house price will be. Specifically for each district, we can find that the distribution of positive and negative correlations is almost opposite to that of DSS in Nanshan District, Futian District and Luohu District. This result confirms our above conjecture.

Figure 19: QASP Weight Distribution

Surprisingly, the relationship between QASP and house prices is relatively weak. Except for the western part of Luohu District, where house prices are strongly positively correlated with QASP, the effect of QASP on house prices is not significant in all other districts in Shenzhen. We believe this is due to the fact that the western part of Luohu District is the old city of Shenzhen, which makes many old residential areas sell themselves by highlighting its mature school districts, resulting in a strong positive correlation effect. In contrast, the new district's high-quality new housing does not have an established school district, and other factors dominate, the impact of the school district is relatively weaker.
