## 6.4 Performance Analysis

The bar chart distribution reveals several key insights about content processing patterns:

- 1. Processing Requirements: The predominance of medium-length articles (138 counts) suggests that most real-world applications will require handling 2-3 context windows, making this the optimal target for performance optimization.
- 2. Resource Utilization: The declining frequency of larger documents (from 138 medium to 8 humongous) indicates that while CAG must handle larger inputs, such cases are relatively rare, allowing for specialized handling without significantly impacting overall system performance.
- 3. Scalability Patterns: The distribution shows that approximately 75% of articles require three or fewer context windows, validating our approach to chunk management and resource allocation.
