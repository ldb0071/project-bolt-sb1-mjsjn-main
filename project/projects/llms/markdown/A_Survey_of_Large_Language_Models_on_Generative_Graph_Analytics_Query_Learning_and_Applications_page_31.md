Graph-formed reasoning is categorized into think on the graph and verify on the graph . Think on the graph refers to using the graph structure to derive the final conclusion during the reasoning process with LLM. On the other hand, verify on the graph involves treating the intermediate or final results generated by LLM as nodes on the graph and using the graph to determine if there are contradictions between the nodes, thus verifying the correctness of the LLM output.

For 'think on the graph', a common issue with existing approaches is their lack of convenience. Compared to CoT and SC, the reasoning processes in current works are complex,

Given the premises provided, we can evaluate the hypothesis "Hyraxes lay eggs

- The only types mammals that eggs are platypuses and echidnas\_ lay
- Platypuses are not hyrax.
- Echidnas are not hyrax .
- Hyraxes are mammals

From premises 1, and 3, Me understand that the only Mammals that eggs are platypuses and echidnas, and that hyraxes are neither platypuses nor echidnas Since hyraxes are mammals (as stated in premise 7), and the only egg laying mammals are platypuses and echidnas, it follows that hyraxes do not lay eggs because do not belong to either those categories lay they

Therefore, the hypothesis "Hyraxes eggs is based on lay

requiring multiple stages of reasoning and validation. Graph of thought methods are not plug and play, which contradicts the original intent of prompts. Even though using more LLMs can simplify the reasoning and validation process, it raises the cost and barrier to entry for reasoning. Therefore, the current challenge is to find a plug-and-play, low-barrier LLM graph reasoning method that improves LLM reasoning capabilities.

For 'verify on the graph', the current approaches have yet to utilize the nature of the graph structure for validation. Existing methods either retrain a model to determine correctness or use a KG for assessment without using the relationships between nodes to infer whether the conclusions within each node in the graph are correct.

Therefore, for the 'think on the graph,' the future direction could focus on developing a plug-and-play, low-barrier LLM graph reasoning method that enhances LLM reasoning abilities, a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. On the other hand, concerning the 'verify on the graph' method, future research could explore how to utilize the relationships between nodes in the graph structure to verify the outputs of LLM or the reasoning process itself.
