## A. Graph

Graph data represents complex relationships through nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent their interconnections. This structure excels at modeling intricate networks such as social, biological, and transportation systems. It enables analyses like community detection and shortest path calculations, offering critical insights into the dynamics of various systems. Formally, a general graph can be represented as G = ( V , E ) , where V and E denote the set of nodes and edges. V = { v 1 , v 2 , ..., v n } where the number of nodes is |V| and |V| = n . E = { e ij } where the number of edges is |E| and e i j is an edge from v i to v j .
