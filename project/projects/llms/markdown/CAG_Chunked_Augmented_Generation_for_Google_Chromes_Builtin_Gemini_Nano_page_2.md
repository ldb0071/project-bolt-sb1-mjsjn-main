## 1. Introduction

Integrating Gemini Nano into Google Chrome marks a revolutionary shift in browser capabilities, transforming it from a simple content delivery platform into an intelligent processing environment. This native AI integration addresses several longstanding challenges: it eliminates external API dependencies, enhances privacy through local processing, and democratizes AI access by making these capabilities available to all Chrome users without additional software or API requirements. However, browser-based AI models face a significant constraint in their limited context window size, which restricts their ability to process larger inputs like extensive documents or codebases. This limitation emerges from the necessary balance between model capability and browser performance constraints, potentially hindering real-world applications requiring substantial data processing. To address this challenge, we introduce Chunked Augmented Generation (CAG), an architectural framework specifically designed for Chrome's Gemini Nano implementation. CAG employs sophisticated chunking strategies and browser-specific optimizations to extend the effective processing capacity of browser-based language models while maintaining performance stability. This framework enables the processing of significantly larger inputs than traditional approaches while preserving semantic coherence, opening new possibilities for sophisticated browser-based AI applications like real-time document analysis, code review, and content summarization.

The practical applications of this integration span diverse use cases, from document processing to content generation. For instance, CAG enables efficient summarization of extensive documents like research papers or books, regardless of their length, while maintaining semantic coherence across sections. The architecture also supports the inverse operation: expanding concise content into detailed expositions, such

as developing comprehensive documentation from technical specifications or converting outline structures into full-length articles. These capabilities are particularly valuable in professional environments where processing lengthy documents locally within the browser enhances both privacy and efficiency.
