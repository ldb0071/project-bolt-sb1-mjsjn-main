## 3.1 Context Window Extension Techniques

Recent advances in extending context windows for large language models have produced several innovative approaches that inform our work. Wang et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive taxonomy of context extension methods, categorizing them into architectural modifications, memory mechanisms, and retrieval-based approaches. While these techniques primarily target server-side models, their principles influence our browser-based implementation.

YARN (Peng et al., 2023) demonstrates the effectiveness of efficient context window extension through dynamic token selection, achieving 128K context windows while maintaining model quality. Similarly, Pawar et al. (2024) survey various context length extension techniques, highlighting the trade-offs between computational efficiency and context retention that helped to innovate our chunking approach.
