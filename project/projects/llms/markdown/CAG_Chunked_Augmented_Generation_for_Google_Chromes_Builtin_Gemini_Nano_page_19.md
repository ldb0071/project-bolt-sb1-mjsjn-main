## 6.1 Dataset Selection and Composition

Our study utilized a carefully curated dataset of Wikipedia articles, chosen for their standardized format, comprehensive coverage, and varying lengths. Wikipedia articles provide an ideal testbed for our research due to their consistent structure, diverse subject matter, and reliable quality standards maintained through community oversight.

Data Collection Process: We developed a systematic approach to collect and validate Wikipedia articles:

- 1. Initial Collection We extracted articles using Wikipedia's API, focusing on featured and good articles to ensure quality standards. The collection process prioritized complete articles rather than stubs or incomplete entries, resulting in an initial pool of 381 articles.
- 2. Quality Filtering Articles underwent a rigorous filtering process:
- ● Removal of articles with excessive tables or non-textual content
- ● Verification of complete citation sections
- ● Confirmation of proper article structure (introduction, body, conclusion)
- ● Validation of minimal template usage
- ● Checking for stable versions without ongoing major edits
- 3. Length Categorization Using our Context Window Length Quotient (CWQ), we categorized the articles into our five defined groups:
- ● Small (CWQ ≤ 1): 87 articles
- ● Medium (1 < CWQ ≤ 2): 140 articles
- ● Large (2 < CWQ ≤ 3): 105 articles
- ● Extra Large (3 < CWQ ≤ 4): 42 articles
- ● Humongous (CWQ > 4): 7 articles
- 4. Topic Distribution To ensure domain diversity, we maintained a balanced distribution across major Wikipedia categories.

This carefully curated Wikipedia dataset provides a robust foundation for evaluating CAG's performance across different content lengths and complexities while maintaining consistency in formatting and quality standards.
