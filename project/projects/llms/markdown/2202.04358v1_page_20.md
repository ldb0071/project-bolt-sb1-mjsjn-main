## 5 Conclusion and Discussion

In the study based on Shenzhen house price data, we have ample evidence to prove the superiority of the GNNWR model over the OLS and GWR models. We use a ten-fold validation approach, and the following results are obtained by predicting for onetenth of the data each time. Using RMSE as the standard, GNNWR improved by 13% compared to GWRand47%compared to OLS. In terms of all other indicators, the GNNWR model shows significant improvement compared to both GWR and OLS. Second, we also performed sufficient tests to demonstrate the robustness of the GNNWR model. The mechanism of ten-fold validation avoids stochastic interference, and tests performed on the test set further demonstrate that the model is fully valid. In the section on hypothesis testing, we analyzed the significance of spatial heterogeneity. Compared with the GWR

model, which also models spatial heterogeneity, and judged with the help of the AICc metric of the training set, it can be found that the improvement in fitting accuracy of the GNNWR model compared with the GWR model is much greater than the improvement in the complexity of the spatial weight matrix. All of these analyses clearly show that GNNWR has good robustness. Finally, we also analyze the spatial heterogeneity explored by GNNWR, which corroborates the outstanding information mining ability of GNNWR model in the context of Shenzhen.

This study focuses on the following innovations. First, GWR, as a relatively traditional modeling method for spatial analysis, commonly used kernel functions only have two choices of bi-square and Gauss. Therefore, the calculated spatial weight matrix often does not adequately reflect the dataset characteristics, which is the original intention of GNNWR being proposed. Second, currently, other studies on modeling house prices with the help of neural networks, hardly introduce a ten-fold validation mechanism. This is a serious problem, and this study was refined based on more mature experimental specifications for neural networks. Third, as some scholars have suggested, the "black box" approach of neural networks has significantly limited the practical significance of neural networks in predicting house prices. [21] Both polynomial regression models and traditional neural network methods depart from the linear structure and have relatively complex expressions, making the analysis and prediction much more difficult. Fourth, neural network prediction methods, that take less geographical location information into account, make their performance unstable. A part of the study highlighted the accuracy of neural network prediction compared to OLS models, [18, 24, 25] but some studies concluded that neural network models often fail to significantly outperform OLS model and its improved models (including hedonic models that correct the dependent variable by log and polynomial regression model). [22,28] But in any case, the RMSEbased metrics show that there are few neural network models with more than 30% improvement compared to OLS.

Since the GNNWR model was proposed, there is no relevant applied research in the socioeconomic field, and this study fills this blank. Future improvements can be made in the following directions. First, the error term in the linear model can be further tested for the linearity, homoscedasticity, independence and normality properties. If they are not satisfied, the dependent variable can be pretreated using the Box-Cox method. Second, more independent variables can be obtained to further expand the choice of independent variables. Third, the independent variables can be preprocessed and filtered. For example, if three independent variables, total number of build-

ings, total number of apartments, and total number of units, are obtained for a certain residential quarter, these independent variables will have multicollinearity. Using PCA, the principal components of these independent variables can be extracted and the multicollinearity can be reduced. Another example is to use more data, such as enrollment rate, distance to school, to evaluate a school district. The independent variables can also be filtered using the forward method, backward method or stepwise method. Fourth, comparable tests can be further performed on other data sets or data from multiple cities can be collected to build a house price prediction benchmark. Fifth, time series analysis can be added to make the GNNWR model have the function of prediction in both time and space.
