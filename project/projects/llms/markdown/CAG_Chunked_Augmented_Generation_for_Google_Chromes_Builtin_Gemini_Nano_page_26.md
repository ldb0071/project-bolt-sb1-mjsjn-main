## CWQ=Content-Length / (Base Token Window Ã— Character-to-Token Ratio)

where the base token window was set to 6,144 tokens (Gemini Nano's context window) and the character-to-token ratio was approximately 4 characters per token.

The experimental objective focused on evaluating CAG's capability to process large content inputs into coherent summaries while maintaining key information and semantic relevance. The testing procedure implemented a recursive chunking strategy, where each content piece was:

- 1. Split into appropriate chunks based on the configured window size
- 2. Processed through Gemini Nano using carefully crafted prompts
- 3. Reduced to approximately 50% of its original size while maintaining semantic coherence
- 4. Recursively processed until meeting target token limits
