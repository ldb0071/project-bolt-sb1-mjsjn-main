## 5.4 Context-Aware Processing for Different Document Types

CAG intelligently adapts its processing approach based on content type and intended audience. This adaptability mirrors how an expert might explain the same topic differently to various audiences. For example, when handling content about quantum physics, CAG can generate both a technically precise version for physics students and an accessible explanation for general readers, adjusting terminology and explanation depth appropriately. This flexibility is implemented through configurable processing parameters and dynamic prompt adjustment mechanisms in the TypeScript interface. The system maintains precise control over output characteristics while ensuring efficient processing within browser constraints, allowing for sophisticated content adaptation without compromising performance. Imagine having a writing assistant that can automatically adapt your content for different audiences - like having an expert who can transform complex technical documents into clear explanations for any reader, while preserving the original meaning. These applications demonstrate how CAG transforms sophisticated AI

document processing into practical, everyday tools while maintaining the technical capabilities needed for research and professional applications. By performing all operations within the browser, CAG ensures privacy and eliminates external API dependencies, making advanced AI document processing accessible to all Chrome users. Overall, CAG brings the power of advanced AI document processing right to your browser - like having a team of expert writers, editors, and researchers at your fingertips, but with complete privacy and no need for external connections.
