In order to overcome the limitations, we consider simultaneously three anomaly measurement types to detect as many anomalies as possible: i) reconstruction-based, ii) density-based, iii) gradient 1 -based anomaly measurements. To compute the three anomaly measurements in a robust manner, we apply score-based generative models (SGMs) [14, 30] to our task. Recent work has demonstrated that SGMs possess great strengths in reproducing high-quality samples and obtaining exact probability densities via score functions, i.e., the gradient of the log-density of samples. We design an SGM-based method for our time-series task since SGMs have been typically studied for images and there exist a few papers for the time-series forecasting only. All three anomaly measurements can be acquired naturally through the training and sampling procedures of our proposed SGM method. To be more speci/fic, we i) design our own conditional score network and ii) redesign the denoising score matching loss [17] for our time-series-based task,
