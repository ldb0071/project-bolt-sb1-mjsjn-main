3.4.1 Reconstruction-based Measurement. Wegenerate 틙 x 洧노 -洧랪 : 洧노 with trained SGMs and extract the expected value 틙 x 洧노 at time 洧노 from the normal temporal trend. We de/fine the following reconstructionbased anomaly measurement as the di/fference between the observed value x 洧노 and the reconstructed value 틙 x 洧노 :
