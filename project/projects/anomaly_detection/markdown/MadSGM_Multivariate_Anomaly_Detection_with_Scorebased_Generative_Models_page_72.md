It is known that the probability /flow ODE is faster but generates poorer samples than that of the reverse SDE. Up to our works, the probability /flow ODE yields similar results with the reverse SDE, but it is averaged 5 times faster (see Table 2), so we only use the probability /flow ODE for our entire experiments. Furthermore, by the instantaneous change of variable theorem [7], we can also exactly compute the conditional log-likelihood log 𝑝 ( x 𝑡 | x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 ) .
