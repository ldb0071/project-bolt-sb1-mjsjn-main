We describe the best hyperparameters of our proposed model for reproducibility. Table 4 provides our best hyperparameters. We set the length (window size) of time-series sequences to 10 and use VP as the type of SDE for all datasets. In the architecture of the conditional score network, 𝑛 𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟 and 𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑛𝑒𝑡 mean the depth of Unet and the number of residual blocks in each layer, respectively. We search 𝑛 𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟 in { 3 , 4 } and 𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑛𝑒𝑡 in { 2 , 3 , 4 } . When we calculate the exact likelihood, we consider { 1 𝑒 -2 , 1 𝑒 -3 } as the tolerance level of probability /flow ODE. For training iterations 𝑛 𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟 , the optimal setting depends on the dataset and we check it every 5000 iterations. For other hyperparameter settings in SGMs, we follow that of VP SDE in Song et al. [30].
