Furthermore, when simultaneously considering both metrics, F1 PA and AUC, the excellence of our proposed method is also demonstrated. When checking only one metric, either F1 PA or AUC, baselines sometimes show good performance. However, when checking both the metrics, it is observed that although the result of one metric is reasonable, that of the other is poor. For example, DeepSVDD and DAGMM have decent performance for the AUC of F1 PA%K , but not for F1 PA . In addition, AT and MAD-GAN of time-series anomaly detectors are somewhat overestimated from the PA%K protocol's perspective, because there are discrepancies in rankings between the F1 PA and AUC of F1 PA%K . However, in all cases, the performance of MadSGM is the best or the second-best for both metrics. Therefore, the e/ffectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by the fact that MadSGM has an overwhelming performance in Table 5, regardless of datasets and metrics.
