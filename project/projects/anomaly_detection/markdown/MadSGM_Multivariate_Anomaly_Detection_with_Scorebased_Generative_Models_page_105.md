In order to achieve stable detection performance, the overall anomalous measurement 𝐴 𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑦 is calculated as the following seven cases by combining them: ˜ 𝐴 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 , ˜ 𝐴 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 , ˜ 𝐴 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 , ˜ 𝐴 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 ∗ ˜ 𝐴 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 , ˜ 𝐴 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 ∗ ˜ 𝐴 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 , ˜ 𝐴 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 ∗ ˜ 𝐴 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 , and ˜ 𝐴 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 ∗ ˜ 𝐴 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 ∗ ˜ 𝐴 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 . It is worth mentioning that the above three measurements typically have di/fferent scales and their arithmetic mean is not appropriate. Therefore, we multiply them as in the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF [21]) widely used in natural language processing - one can also consider that our de/finition is the geometric mean of the three measurements without the cube root. We also point out that multiplying two measurements has been used
