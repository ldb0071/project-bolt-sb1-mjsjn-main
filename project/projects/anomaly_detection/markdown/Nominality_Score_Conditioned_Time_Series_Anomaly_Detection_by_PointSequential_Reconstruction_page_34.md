## H Limitations

Despite exhibiting competitive performance against other models, the proposed NPSR algorithm has a few limitations. The point-based model used in training does not incorporate temporal information, which makes it challenging to effectively reconstruct low-dimensional datasets. This issue is particularly challenging for univariate time series since raw inputs would not work for point-based models. One possible solution to this problem is to increase dimensionality by aggregating multiple time points. However, the effectiveness of this approach is yet to be confirmed.

Another limitation of NPSR is the absence of an automatic threshold ( θ a )-finding method, which makes it difficult to determine a suitable threshold when deploying the model. To address this issue, one can define a target false positive rate and estimate the threshold that achieves this target rate using the validation set since only normal data is needed. Similarly, estimating the optimal values for θ N , d , and selecting the model used for calculating A ( · ) will be an important future work.

Within Fig. 5b of the main text, a false negative instance was identified in the temporal range between t = 14800 and t = 14900 when employing the induced anomaly score. According to the WADI dataset, this anomaly spans approximately 14.26 minutes and is characterized as "Damage 1 MV 001 and raw water pump to drain Elevated Reservoir tank." Notably, our analysis suggests that when assessing individual time points, the model M pt encounters difficulty in recognizing this anomaly. Conversely, the model M seq excels in identifying time-dependent relationships, making it more effective in capturing such contextual anomalies. The observed disparity in anomaly detection implies that this section comprises a relatively higher proportion of contextual anomalies than point anomalies. Consequently, when using M seq , we achieve a higher anomaly score. However, our current approach utilizes the reconstruction error of M pt as the basis for the anomaly score calculation, thus neglecting the effectiveness of the reconstruction error generated by M seq . Consequently, the induced anomaly score fails to surpass the predefined threshold. In light of these findings, an essential avenue for future research is to investigate methods for selecting the model to be used in the computation of A ( · ) . This undertaking holds promise for enhancing the overall performance and accuracy of anomaly detection in time series data.
