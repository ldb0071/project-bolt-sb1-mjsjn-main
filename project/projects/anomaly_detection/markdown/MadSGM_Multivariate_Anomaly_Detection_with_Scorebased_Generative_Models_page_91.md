However, the above three anomaly measurement de/finitions can be unstable when x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 includes anomalous observations. For instance, 𝐴 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) should be high (resp. low) when x 𝑡 is an anomalous (e.g., legitimate) observation, which is not always guaranteed in such a case (cf. the upper /figure of Figure 2). This phenomenon occurs for other two anomaly measurement de/finitions as well.
