Here, 𝜆 ( 𝑙 ) > 0 is a weighting function as in Song et al. [30]. Note that our conditional score network is trained for both 𝐿 1 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝐿 2 ( 𝑡 ) . As such, for 𝐿 2 ( 𝑡 ) , so to use x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 as the input of the /first part of the 𝑆 𝜽 (· , · , ·) , we concatenate x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 and 0 to match its dimension with x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 of 𝐿 1 ( 𝑡 ) . We denote the concatenated data as ¯ x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 . Lim et al. [17] proved that the denoising conditional score matching loss 𝐿 1 ( 𝑡 ) is equivalent to the explicit conditional score matching loss,
