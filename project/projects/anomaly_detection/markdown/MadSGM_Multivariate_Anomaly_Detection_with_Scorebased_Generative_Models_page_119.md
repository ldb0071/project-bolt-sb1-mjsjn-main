We compare the MadSGM with several types of unsupervised anomaly detection methods: density-based, boundary-based, and reconstruction-based methods. At /first, DAGMM [42] is used as the density-based method. Next, the boundary-based method contains OCSVM [33] with RBF kernel and DeepSVDD [23]. Both density-based and boundary-based models can't use a sliding window input since they are not designed to deal with the temporal dependency. Finally, we consider six reconstruction-based models for time-series anomaly detection, including VAE-based methods: LSTM-VAE [20] and OmniAnomaly [31]; GAN-based methods: MAD-GAN [16], TAnoGAN [3], and USAD [2]; a Transformerbased method: AT [38].
