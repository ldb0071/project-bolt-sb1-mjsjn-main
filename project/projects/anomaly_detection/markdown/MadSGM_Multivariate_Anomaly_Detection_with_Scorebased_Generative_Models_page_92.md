To alleviate this problem, we propose to purify, to get rid of anomalous observations if any, the condition part of the anomaly measurement de/finitions, i.e., x 洧노 -洧랪 : 洧노 -1 . We resort to the adversarial puri/fication method (cf. Sec. 2.3), i.e., adding slight noises to a sample via the forward process of SGM and denoising it via the reserve process. Throughout the denoising process, all non-legitimate signals can be removed from the sample. Detailed puri/fication and anomaly detection procedure is provided in Algorithm 1. Our puri/fication step adopts the forward and reverse processes of SGMs to purify x 洧노 -洧랪 : 洧노 -1 with the following steps (cf. Figure 3):
