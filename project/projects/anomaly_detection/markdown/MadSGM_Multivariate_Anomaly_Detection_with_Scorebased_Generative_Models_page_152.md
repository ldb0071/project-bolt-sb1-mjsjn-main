By changing a solver method for the probability /flow ODE in Section 3.3, we observe the e/ffect of the solver on the anomaly detection task. We test a total of 3 solvers: explicit Runge-Kutta methods with order 5(4) (RK45, default) [9, 26], order 3(2) (RK23) [4], and order 8 (DOP853) [12]. Table 8 shows the result of this ablation study in MSL and PSM. In almost all cases, there are only negligible differences in detection results among the three solvers. However,
