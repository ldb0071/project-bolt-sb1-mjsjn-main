3.4.3 Gradient-based Measurement. The score function gives the direction of change in the log probability and the magnitude of change in that direction. Even if the probability values of normal and abnormal samples are similar, a signi/ficant di/fference in the gradient allows us to distinguish an anomaly from normal behavior. The gradient-based anomaly measurement de/fined by the norm of the conditional score function is given as
