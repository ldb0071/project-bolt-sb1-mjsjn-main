## 5 Conclusion

In conclusion, we introduce an improved framework for unsupervised time series anomaly detection. We specify the relationships between point and contextual anomalies and derive the nominality score and induced anomaly score to provide a theory-based algorithm with provable superiority. NPSR captures both point and contextual anomalies, resulting in a high combined precision and recall. Our results show that NPSR exhibits high performance, is widely applicable, and has a relatively straightforward training process. It has the potential to decrease labor needs for fault monitoring and correspondingly accelerates decision making and can also contribute to AI sustainability by preventing energy waste or system failure.
