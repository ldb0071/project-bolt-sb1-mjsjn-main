In order to design our conditional score network, we modify the reputed U-net architecture [22] to capture temporal dependencies better. From the U-net architecture, we replace its 2-dimensional convolutional layers with 1-dimensional ones and follow the miscellaneous structures in [29, 30]. After concatenating the di/ffused sample and the condition, we feed it into our conditional score network. We refer the readers to Section 4.4 for the detailed architecture and its hyperparameters.
