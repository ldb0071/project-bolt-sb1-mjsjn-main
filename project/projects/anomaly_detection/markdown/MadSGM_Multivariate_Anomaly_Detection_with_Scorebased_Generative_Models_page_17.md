Time-series-based applications are abundant in our daily life. For instance, tra/ffic condition monitoring systems [36], and industrial/scienti/fic remote sensing systems [8] are their representative examples. One common task in those applications is to detect anomalous observations, which may cause severe damage to our society. However, it is hard to label anomalous observations and perform supervised training. Therefore, most of the well-known time-series anomaly detection algorithms are unsupervised (or selfsupervised). These existing methods are known to be successful for many time-series datasets. Nevertheless, one limitation of most existing detection methods is that they resort to a single type of anomaly measurement, such as reconstruction-based or densitybased anomaly measurement (see Table 1). A single type of anomaly measurement may not work well in real-world time-series data due to its complicated characteristics. For example, when normal points are similar to abnormal ones in a feature space, reconstructionbased models frequently fail. Moreover, it is di/fficult for densitybased models to discern between normal points in a low-density region and abnormal points whose probabilities are naturally low.
