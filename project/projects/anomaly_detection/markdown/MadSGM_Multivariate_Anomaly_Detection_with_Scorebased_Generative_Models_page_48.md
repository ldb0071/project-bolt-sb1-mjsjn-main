where ˜ f ( x 𝑙 , 𝑙 ) = f ( x 𝑙 , 𝑙 ) -1 2 𝑔 2 ( 𝑙 )∇ x 𝑙 log 𝑝 ( x 𝑙 ) . The Hutchinson's trace estimator enables the unbiased linear-time estimation of ∇ x 𝑙 · ˜ f ( x 𝑙 , 𝑙 ) [11]. As such, we can use both the generated samples and the log-likelihood computed from the probability /flow ODE to de/fine the proposed anomaly measurement described in Section 3.
