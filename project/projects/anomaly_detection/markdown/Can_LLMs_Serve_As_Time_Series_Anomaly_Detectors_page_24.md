Figure 16 and Figure 17 present additional examples of responses generated by GPT-4 and LLaMA3 on the trial cases. The responses produced by LLaMA3 are significantly more unstable compared to those from GPT-4. For instance, when identifying global point anomalies, LLaMA3 can yield different outputs for the same prompt. Although LLaMA3 does not benefit much from prompt engineering, differences can still be observed before and after applying prompting strategies. In some cases, LLaMA3 provides responses that closely match the ideal answers.
