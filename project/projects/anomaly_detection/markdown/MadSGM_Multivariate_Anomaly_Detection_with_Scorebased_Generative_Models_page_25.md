Anomaly detection is the process to /find rare observations deviating from a normal pattern distribution. However, because abnormal observations are scarce [5] and it is hard to collect and label abnormal observations, we cannot easily apply supervised learning to anomaly detection. Therefore, an unsupervised setting is common in an anomaly detection task. There are several methods for this
