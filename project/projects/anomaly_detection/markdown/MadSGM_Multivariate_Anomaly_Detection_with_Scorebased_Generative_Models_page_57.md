For non-sequential data such as images [25] and tables [28], anomaly detection methods can independently determine whether each sample is abnormal or not, whereas in the time-series domain there exist temporal dependencies among observations, requiring a di/fferent approach utilizing them. Therefore, to capture the conditional data distribution 𝑝 ( x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 | x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 ) , the score network 𝑆 𝜽 (· , · , ·) must take 3 inputs: a di/ffusion step 𝑙 , a di/ffused sample x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 , and a condition x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 . The conditional score network 𝑆 𝜽 ( x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 , x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 , 𝑙 ) estimates the gradient of the conditional log probability ∇ x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 log 𝑝 ( x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 | x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 ) , called as conditional score function.
