Detect ranges of anomalies in this time series, in terms of the x-axis coordinate. List one by one, in JSON format. If there are no anomalies, answer with an empty list [].

Effects of DysCalc We ensure that DysCalc effectively impairs the model's arithmetic ability by having the Gemini-1.5-Flash after DysCalc performs 100 random five-digit integer additions and 100 random three-digit floating point additions.

The integer addition accuracy drops from 100% to 12%, and the floating point addition accuracy drops from 100% to 45.0%. Meanwhile, the Calc variant maintains 100% accuracy in both cases.

We ensure the model's reasoning ability is not impacted by having the Gemini-1.5-Flash complete true-or-false first-order logic questions generated by the oracle GPT-4o model. Both DysCalc and Calc variants achieve 100% accuracy.

## B DATASET DETAILS

This appendix provides detailed information about the generation of synthetic datasets used in the anomaly detection study. Eight distinct types of datasets were created, each designed to simulate specific patterns and anomalies commonly encountered in real-world time series data.

## COMMON PARAMETERS

All datasets share the following common parameters:

- · Number of time series per dataset: 400
- · Number of samples per time series: 1000
