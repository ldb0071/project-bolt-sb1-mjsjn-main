Density-based methods estimate the distribution of normal data and can compute probabilities of normal and abnormal points. The assumption of these methods is that in the estimated distribution, the probability of anomalous observations is lower than that of normal ones. LOF [6] is a traditional method calculating local density for outlier determination. DAGMM [42] combines an autoencoder for dimension reduction with a /finite gaussian mixture model for density estimation of latent variables. Adaptive-KD [41] estimates local densities using an adaptive kernel density estimation approach in nonlinear systems.
