Firstly, we observe that M pt outperforms M seq and achieves competitive results on its own, despite not modeling the time-dependent relationships. Secondly, by smoothing A ( · ) (third row), the AUC and F1 ∗ are increased for most datasets. This means smoothing is generally an effective method for improving performance. Moreover, our experiments show that the soft gate function along with an appropriate θ N performed the best on average in terms of F1 ∗ . This suggests that the distribution of nominality scores is predominantly overlapped, and a soft gate function will be more appropriate to prevent excessive accumulation of anomaly scores on normal time points, reducing false-positives (cf. Appendix F). This method will also have a generally stable AUC and F1 ∗ (low σ d ) across a wide range of d . This makes sense - when time point τ is farther away from time point t , more gate function outputs are multiplied onto A ( τ ) , hence A ( t, τ ) → 0 . However, the results also suggest that the best choice of gate function and θ N may depend on the specific dataset at hand.
