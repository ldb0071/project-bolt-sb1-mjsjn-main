## G Broader Impacts

The detection of anomalies in time series data can minimize downtime and avert financial losses. Utilizing real-time monitoring of system conditions, anomaly detection techniques for time series data can automatically detect deviations from the expected system behavior, thereby avoiding potential risks and financial harm. This has the potential to reduce the need for manual monitoring of faults and to expedite decision-making processes. Additionally, it can promote the sustainability of AI by preventing energy wastage and system malfunction.
