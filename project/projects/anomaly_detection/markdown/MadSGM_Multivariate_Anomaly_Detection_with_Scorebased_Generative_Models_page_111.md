In this section, we conduct experiments to illustrate the performance of the MadSGM on /five real-world datasets from various /fields with nine benchmark baselines. In particular, our collection of baselines covers various types of time-series anomaly detection methods, ranging from transformer-based models to VAEs and GANs. For the baselines, we reuse their released source codes in their o/fficial repositories and rely on their designed training procedures. Details of the software and hardware environment used in our experiments are as follow: U/b.sc/u.sc/n.sc/t.sc/u.sc 18.04 LTS, P/y.sc/t.sc/h.sc/o.sc/n.sc 3.9.12, CUDA 9.1, NVIDIA Driver 470.141, i9 CPU, and G/e.scF/o.sc/r.sc/c.sc/e.sc RTX 2080 T/i.sc.
