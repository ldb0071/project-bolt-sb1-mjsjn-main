Table 5 provides that the MadSGM performs well in all datasets with the highest or the second-best results. Especially, for all datasets, the MadSGM shows overwhelming performance in terms of the AUC of F1 PA%K . For F1 PA , the MadSGM outperforms all the baselines on all datasets except MSL. Figure 4 demonstrates that for all ùêæ , the proposed methods has higher values of F1 PA%K than LSTMVAE, DeepSVDD, and TAnoGAN. By the average rank of the last column in Table 5, it generally has a more reliable performance than the current state-of-the-art irrespective of evaluation metrics, which shows its robust detection performance. In other words, the proposed method can cope with all datasets using the broadest ever set of anomaly measurements, while most existing methods work well only with speci/fic datasets. For instance, whereas DAGMM earns the second-best results on the PSM and SMD datasets, for the SWaT and SMAP datasets with long-time sequences, it doesn't achieve reasonable performance.
