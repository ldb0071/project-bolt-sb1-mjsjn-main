In this section, we describe the proposed anomaly detection method in detail. The key points in our method are that i) we use a conditional score network to preserve the temporal dependencies on time-series and introduce a denoising score matching loss function to train the conditional score network for the purpose of anomaly detection, ii) we de/fine three types of anomaly measurements: a) reconstruction-based, b) probability-based, c) gradient-based anomaly measurements, and iii) we propose a calibrating strategy based on a puri/fication method for the conditional input of our conditional score network.
