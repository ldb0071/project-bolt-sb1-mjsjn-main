However, there exists one subtle point in our autoregressive approach. Once an anomalous observation is fed into our method, all following observations can be predicted as anomalies in the worst case - in other words, the prior anomalous observation in/fluences its following normal observations, which is not preferred since our task is to pinpoint a narrow temporal window with anomalies. Thus, we need to prevent the propagation of anomaly decisions and do it via a puri/fication step, which is the process of calibrating anomaly measurement (see Sec. 3.5). The puri/fication step consists of two operations: noising and denoising. First, we add noises to the prior observations and then denoise to derive puri/fied observations. At the end, we use them as a condition for sampling the next observation during our autoregressive processing. We found that this approach signi/ficantly stabilizes the overall processing and therefore, we can extract the reconstruction-based, density-based, and gradient-based anomaly measurements in a robust manner - we call them as calibrated anomaly measurements in order to distinguish them from na√Øve ones (cf. Sec. 3.4 vs. Sec. 3.5).
