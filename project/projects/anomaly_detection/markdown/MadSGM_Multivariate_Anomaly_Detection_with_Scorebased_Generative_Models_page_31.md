As for the boundary-based methods, it is supposed that in a good representation space, there is a boundary that distinguishes abnormal points from normal ones. OCSVM [33] maps the training data into the feature space via kernel functions and /finds an optimal hyperplane of maximal margin that separates the normal data from the origin. DeepSVDD [23] constructs neural networks to /find a hypersphere of minimum volume that includes the normal data on the latent space. THOC [27] extracts multi-scale temporal features by using a multi-layer dilated RNN and builds a hierarchical structure with multiple hyperspheres for each resolution.
