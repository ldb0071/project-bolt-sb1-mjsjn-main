We conduct experiments on /five benchmark datasets with nine baselines. To assess the detection performance, we mainly use the F1-score with the PA%K strategy as our main evaluation metric, which is known to be more appropriate for the time-series anomaly detection. We also consider the widely-used point adjustment approach. Our model shows the best detection performance in terms of the two evaluation metrics on almost all datasets. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
