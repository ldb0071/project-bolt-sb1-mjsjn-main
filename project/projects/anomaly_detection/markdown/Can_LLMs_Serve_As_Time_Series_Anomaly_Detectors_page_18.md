## Global Point Anomaly - Correct in all instructions

Yes, there is an anomaly in the time series. The anomaly occurs at index 11 (0-based indexing). The average (mean) value of the series is approximately 1.55 with a standard deviation of about 0.92. Typically, a point is considered anomalous if it lies more than 2 standard deviations from the mean. Here, the value at index 11 is 5, which exceeds the mean by more than 2 standard deviations, hence it is considered anomalous.
