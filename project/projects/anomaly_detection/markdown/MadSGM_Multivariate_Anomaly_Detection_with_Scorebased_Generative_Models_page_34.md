Usually, extant studies are based on only one type of method. However, it is not desirable to stick to a single one. This is because the complex nature of real-world time-series data makes it hard for only one of the methods to be su/fficient. Therefore, we devise our model which can utilize multiple methods at the same time. We show the e/ffectiveness of combining multiple methods in Section 5.1.
