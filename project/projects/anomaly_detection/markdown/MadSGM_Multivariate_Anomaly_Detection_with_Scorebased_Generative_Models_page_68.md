𝑆 𝜽 ( ¯ x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 , 0 , 𝑙 ) ≈ ∇ ¯ x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 log 𝑝 ( ¯ x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 ) . We point out that 𝐿 2 ( 𝑡 ) is the naïve denoising score matching loss as in Song et al. [30], whereas 𝐿 1 ( 𝑡 ) is the conditional score matching loss devised by Lim et al. [17]. The conditional score function learned by 𝐿 1 ( 𝑡 ) and 𝐿 2 ( 𝑡 ) has di/fferent roles in anomaly detection. The conditional score function from 𝐿 1 ( 𝑡 ) is used to calculate the anomaly measurement (Section 3.4) and that from 𝐿 2 ( 𝑡 ) is for puri/fication (Section 3.5) which is to adjust the conditional values of the score network in anomaly detection. The entire training process of our proposed model is shown in Figure 1.
