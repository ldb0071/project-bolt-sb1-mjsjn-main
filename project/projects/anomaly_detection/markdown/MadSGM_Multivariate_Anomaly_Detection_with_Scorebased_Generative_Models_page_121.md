Most works for the time-series domain have adopted the widelyused point adjustment approach, introduced by [37]: if any time point in a successive anomaly segment is detected, all observations in this segment are regarded to be correctly detected as anomalies. The F1-score with the point-adjust way denoted as F1 PA is more suitable for range-based anomalies than the naive F1-score (F1). The F1 PA will be higher than the F1.
