In this section, we conduct anomaly detection tasks by varying the type of anomaly measurements. As in Section 3.4, our method evaluates 3 types of anomaly measurements: i) reconstruction-based measurement, 𝐴 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 , ii) probability-based measurement, 𝐴 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 , and iii) gradient-based measurement, 𝐴 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 . When we consider all combinations of 3 types, by multiplying each other, there are 7 types of anomaly measurements in total. Table 6 shows that the best type of anomaly measurement di/ffers depending on datasets and evaluation metrics. In other words, one type of anomaly measurement doesn't always give the best performance. We also give representative visualizations to support our claims in Figure 5. Therefore, this subsection demonstrates the importance of considering various types of anomaly measurements simultaneously to achieve the best performance in anomaly detection - note that our proposed method considers a broader set of anomaly measurements than any other baseline methods (see Table 1).
