where f (· , 𝑙 ) : R 𝑛 → R 𝑛 and 𝑔 : [ 0 , 1 ] → R denote drift and diffusion coe/fficients of x 𝑙 , respectively, and w ∈ R 𝑛 is a Brownian motion. There are several types of SDE such as variance exploding (VE), variance preserving (VP), and subVP, depending on the de/finition of coe/fficients f and 𝑔 as in Song et al. [30]. A di/ffusion process { x 𝑙 } 𝑙 ∈[ 0 , 1 ] can be derived by solving the SDE (1). By su/fficiently perturbing the data x 0 using SDE, the distribution of x 1 at the end step can be approximated by the noise distribution.
