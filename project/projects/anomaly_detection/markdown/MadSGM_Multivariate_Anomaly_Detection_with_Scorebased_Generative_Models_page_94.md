Since the model learns a distribution of the training data, which consist mostly of normal observations, we can restore to the most appropriate puri/fied sample from the potentially abnormal condition. Note that the di/fference will be larger (resp. small) if the condition contains anomalies (resp. normal observations) after the puri/fication (cf. the lower /figure of Figure 2). By appropriately setting the hyperparameter ùúè , we can control how aggressively the conditional data is puri/fied.
