However, Kim et al. [15] argued some limitations in which F1 PA has a high possibility to be overestimated. They provided empirical evidence that a random anomaly measurement outperformed state-of-the-art methods on almost all benchmark datasets. For this reason, they proposed an alternative evaluation metric named by PA%K which can remedy both the overestimation of F1 PA and underestimation of F1.
