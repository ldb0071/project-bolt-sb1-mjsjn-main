After purifying the condition, we achieve a calibrated condition, denoted ˜ x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 . By replacing the original condition with the puri/fied one, we can get the following calibrated conditional score network, 𝑆 𝜽 ( x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 , ˜ x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 , 𝑙 ) ≈ ∇ x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 log 𝑝 ( x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 | ˜ x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 ) . We then generate a calibrated sample, ˜ x 𝑡 . Therefore we attain the following calibrated anomaly measurement de/finitions:
