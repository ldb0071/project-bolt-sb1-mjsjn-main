where both l 1 -norm and l 2 -norm can be used as the norm, ∥ · ∥ . Although both cases can be used in experiments, we observe that using l 1 -norm outperforms l 2 -norm, so we only adopt l 1 -norm in our experiments. The conditional score function can be replaced with conditional score network 𝑆 𝜽 ( x 0 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 , x 0 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 , 0 ) . We also describe the relationship between score function and log probability.
