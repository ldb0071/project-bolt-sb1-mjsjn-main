There are two numerical approaches to solve the reverse SDE for sampling: the predictor-corrector and using well-known ODE solvers on probability /flow ODE [7]. The ODE solver can be used to the following ordinary di/fferential equation (ODE) which has the same probability distribution of x ùëô as that of the SDE (Eq. (1)):
