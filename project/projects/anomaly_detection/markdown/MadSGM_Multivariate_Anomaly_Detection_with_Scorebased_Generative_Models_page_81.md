- 3.4.2 Probability-based Measurement. In the sampling procedure of SGMs, the probability /flow ODE computes the log conditional probability log 𝑝 ( x 𝑡 | x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 ) with Eq. (2) that captures temporal dependencies of normal points. Due to the sparsity of anomalous samples, the probability of anomalies tends to be extremely low. Therefore, we de/fine a probability-based anomaly measurement as a negative log conditional probability as follows:
