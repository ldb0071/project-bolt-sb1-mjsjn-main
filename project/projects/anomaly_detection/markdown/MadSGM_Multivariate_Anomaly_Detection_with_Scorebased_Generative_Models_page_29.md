The reconstruction-based methods assume that anomalous samples can't be accurately reconstructed by their trained models. Their anomaly measurements are based on the reconstruction error. LSTM-VAE [20] utilizes LSTMs in variational autoencoder (VAE) to take into account the temporal dependency of time-series data. OmniAnomaly [31] adds a stochastic module in the LSTM-VAE to capture stochastic properties in time-series. MAD-GAN [16] and TAnoGAN [3] use a GAN architecture composed of a discriminator and a generator with LSTM layers. It detects anomalies using both discrimination and reconstruction losses. USAD [2] employs two autoencoders and trains them with adversarial loss to isolate anomalous samples and provide fast training. MSCRED [40] constructs attention-based ConvLSTM networks for temporal modeling and a convolutional autoencoder to compress and reconstruct the inter-sensor (time-series) correlation patterns. For AT [38], they introduce the series-association from Transformers [34] and Gaussian prior-association to di/fferentiate between normal and abnormal patterns. TadGAN [10] not only uses reconstruction error like other GAN-based methods, but also devises other measurement by using discriminator, which is called 'Critic'. TadGAN mainly focuses on univariate time-series, but it can be generalized into multivariate time-series.
