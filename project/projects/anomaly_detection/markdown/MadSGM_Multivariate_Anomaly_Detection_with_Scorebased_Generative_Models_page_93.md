- (1) This step is to blur the anomalies by adding noises to the conditional data. We /first consider the concatenation of the conditional data x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 and 0, denoted by ¯ x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 , to match its size with that of the input of 𝑆 𝜽 (· , · , ·) . We perturb ¯ x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 from di/ffusion step 𝑙 = 0 to 𝑙 = 𝜏 with forward SDE, where 𝜏 ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] is a hyperparameter to control the extent of noise added. ¯ x 𝜏 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 denotes the perturbed conditional data. (cf. Line 1-2 of Algorithm 1)
- (2) In this step, we produce a puri/fied conditional data by gradually removing the noises (and potential anomalous values if any). We generate a sample ¯ x 0 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 from ¯ x 𝜏 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 by solving the reverse SDE based on the trained conditional score network. We take the puri/fied condition ˜ x 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 of length 𝜔 from the generated sample ¯ x 0 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 . (cf. Line 3-5 of Algorithm 1).
