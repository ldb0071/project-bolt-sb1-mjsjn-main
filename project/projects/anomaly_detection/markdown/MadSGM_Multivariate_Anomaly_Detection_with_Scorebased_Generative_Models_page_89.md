On a minimum point of the log-likelihood plane, the left term will be small, which means the log probability doesn't change in the neighborhood of x . To be more speci/fic, the lower this measurement of x ùë° is, the more likely it is to be normal. So we can consider the score function as the milestone of local minimum. Unlike other works which deal with only the probability, we focus on the local optimum, not on the point only, therefore we get a better strategy than other baselines. We demonstrate its performance in the experiments section.
