We compare our proposed methods with several popular anomaly detection models on /five real-world datasets. We calculate evaluation metrics after a certain time point since time-series anomaly detectors use di/fferent sizes of the sliding window. Note that MadSGM generates de/finite sample since it uses probability /flow ODE, which follows /fixed path (see Section 3.3). Therefore we achieve constant results on various seeds, like other non-generative models.
