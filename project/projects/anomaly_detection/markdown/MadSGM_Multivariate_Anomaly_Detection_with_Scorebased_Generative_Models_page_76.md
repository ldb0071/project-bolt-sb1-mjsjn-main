Anomalies are unusual observations that deviate from normal behaviors. We de/fine SGM-based anomaly measurements using a conditional score network that learns normal patterns from training data. In particular, to detect tricky anomalies, we use the advantages of SGM, which generates high-quality samples and provides an estimate of the gradient of log probability. We determine whether a sample for time step 𝑡 > 𝑇 is normal or abnormal using the previous observations. The proposed anomaly measurement consists of i) reconstruction-based measurement, 𝐴 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 , ii) probability-based measurement, 𝐴 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 , and iii) gradient-based measurement, 𝐴 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑 , which are explained from following subsection.
