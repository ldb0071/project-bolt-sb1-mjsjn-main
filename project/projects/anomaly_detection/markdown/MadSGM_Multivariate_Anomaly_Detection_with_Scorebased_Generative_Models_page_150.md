𝜏 in { 0 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 15 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 25 } . Especially, 𝜏 = 0 means to perform anomaly detection without puri/fication. In this section, the reason why the puri/fication process is needed is con/firmed. In Table 7, conducting anomaly detection without the puri/fication (i.e., 𝜏 = 0) achieves reasonable results. However, for some datasets and evaluation metrics, the puri/fication process (i.e., 𝜏 > 0) is helpful for improving performance. In particular, the performance of SMAP and MSL was signi/ficantly improved by using the puri/fication strategy. These meaningful results come from the e/ffect of blurring and purifying anomalies in the conditional data which makes a signi/ficant di/fference between the observed and reconstructed (generated) values (see Figure 2). In this regard, Table 7 shows the e/fficacy of our puri/fication process.
