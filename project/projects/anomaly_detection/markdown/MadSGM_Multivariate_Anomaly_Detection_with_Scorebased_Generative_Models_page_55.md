challenging environment that all observations in our training data {T 洧녱 } 洧녜 洧녱 = 1 are unlabeled, i.e., unsupervised training. When training our model and computing the anomaly measurement, our prediction granularity is a window x 洧노 -洧랪 : 洧노 = { x 洧노 -洧랪 , 췅 췅 췅 , x 洧노 } . In other words, our task is to detect whether each window has anomalies or not.
