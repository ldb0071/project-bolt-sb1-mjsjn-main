Reconstruction-based techniques have seen a diversity of approaches over the years. The simplest reconstruction technique involves training a separate model sequentially for each channel using UAE [11]. One type of improvement focuses on network architecture, with notable examples like LSTMVAE [22], MAD-GAN [23], MSCRED [24], OmniAnomaly [9], and TranAD [25]. Additionally, hybrid architectures like DAGMM [26] and MTAD-GAT [27] have been proposed. Another type aims to improve the anomaly score instead of using the original reconstruction error. Designing this anomaly score involves a considerable amount of art, given the high diversity of methods for calculating it across studies. For instance, USAD uses two weighted reconstruction errors [28], OmniAnomaly employs the "reconstruction probability" as an alternative anomaly score [9], MTADGAT combines forecasting error and reconstruction probability [27], and TranAD uses an integrated reconstruction error and discriminator loss as the anomaly score [25]. In the context of network architecture, our method utilizes a straightforward performer-based structure without incorporating any specialized components. Based on our insights into the point-sequential detection tradeoff, our approach stands out by integration of point-based and sequence-based reconstruction errors for competitive performance.
