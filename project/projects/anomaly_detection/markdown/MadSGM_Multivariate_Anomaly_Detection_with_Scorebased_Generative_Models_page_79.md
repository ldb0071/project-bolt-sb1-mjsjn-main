Figure 2: Comparison between the anomaly measurement without and with the puri/fication process. The manifold represents a space where normal data distribution lies. (upper) Given the abnormal condition x 洧노 -洧랪 : 洧노 -1 , the reconstructed observation 틙 x 洧노 will be close to the abnormal observation x 洧노 . (lower) Given the puri/fied condition, the reconstructed observation will be far from the abnormal observation.
