which is specialized for capturing subtle points between normal observations and anomalies. Our designed conditional SGM method, which consists of a conditional score network and its denoising score matching training, is basically autoregressive since it learns ∇ x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 log 𝑝 ( x 𝑙 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 | x 0 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 ) at the di/ffusion step 𝑙 - in other words, our SGM model is able to sample x 0 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 given x 0 𝑡 -𝜔 : 𝑡 -1 .
