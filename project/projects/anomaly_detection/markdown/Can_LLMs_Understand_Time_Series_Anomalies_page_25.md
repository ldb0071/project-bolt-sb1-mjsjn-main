## 3. TREND ANOMALIES

- · Normal data: Steady but slowly increasing trend from -1 to 1
- · Anomalies: Data appears to either increase much faster or decrease, deviating from the normal trend. The probability of negating the trend is 50%.
- · Generation parameters:
- -Frequency: 0.02
- -Normal duration rate: 1700.0
- -Anomaly duration rate: 100.0

- -Minimum anomaly duration: 50
- -Minimum normal duration: 800
- -Normal slope: 3.0
- -Abnormal slope range: (6.0, 20.0)

## · Statistics:

- -Average anomaly ratio: 0.0377
- -Number of time series without anomalies: 230 (57.50%)
- -Average number of anomalies per time series: 0.42
- -Maximum number of anomalies in a single time series: 1
- -Average length of an anomaly: 88.61
- -Maximum length of an anomaly: 200.0

## 4. FREQUENCY ANOMALIES

- · Normal data: Periodic sine wave between -1 and 1
- · Anomalies: Sudden changes in frequency, with very different periods between peaks
- · Generation parameters:
- -Frequency: 0.03
- -Normal duration rate: 450.0
- -Anomaly duration rate: 15.0
- -Minimum anomaly duration: 7
- -Minimum normal duration: 20
- -Frequency multiplier: 3.0

## · Statistics:

- -Average anomaly ratio: 0.0341
- -Number of time series without anomalies: 40 (10.00%)
- -Average number of anomalies per time series: 2.16
- -Maximum number of anomalies in a single time series: 7
