## 2.3 Materials

We administered two validated personality questionnaires. Prior to any analysis, reversescored items were recoded.

The first questionnaire is the HEXACO-60 (H60) [20], a shortened version of the 100-item HEXACO-PI-R [21]. The H60 consists of 60 items (e.g. 'Most people tend to get angry more quickly than I do.') answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ('strongly disagree') to 5 ('strongly agree'). The H60 measures six dimensions of personality, evaluated by 10 items each: Honesty-Humility , Emotionality , eXtraversion , Agreeableness , Conscientiousness , and Openness to experience . Cronbach's alpha values for internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.77 (Agreeableness and Openness) to 0.80 (Extraversion) in a college sample and from 0.73 (Emotionality and Extraversion) to 0.80 (Openness) in a community sample [20]. Item-level factor analysis of H60 responses revealed the same factor structure as found in the validation study of the longer version of the questionnaire [20, 21].

The second instrument is the Dark Side of Humanity Scale (DSHS) [22], which is a reconstruction of the Dark Tetrad personality traits [23]. The questionnaire consists of 42 items (e.g. 'I enjoy seeing people hurt'), answered on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ('not

at all like me') to 6 ('very much like me'). Underlying dimensions of the construct are Successful Psychopathy (18 items), Grandiose Entitlement (9 items), Sadistic Cruelty (8 items), and Entitlement Rage (7 items). Cronbach's alpha values for internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.87 (Entitlement Rage) to 0.95 (Successful Psychopathy) in earlier research [22]. The factor structure was confirmed through an extensive validation analysis [22].

The DSHS was published in December of 2021, preventing any training data contamination in the GPT-3.5-T and GPT-4 responses. The DSHS also functions as a supplemental measure of construct validity: scores on the dark personality traits the DSHS is based on were found to be strongly inversely related to the same respondents' scores on the Humility-Honesty dimension of the H60 [24]. This finding intuitively makes sense as these constructs are conceptually antithetical to one another.
