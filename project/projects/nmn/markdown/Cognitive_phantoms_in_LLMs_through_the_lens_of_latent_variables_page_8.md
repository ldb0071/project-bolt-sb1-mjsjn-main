## 1.4 The present study

While approaches from machine behaviour and psychology can be a useful guiding framework for studying LLMs (and AI models more generally), we argue that the current underlying measurement theoretical approach is insufficient to fully grasp the nuances of LLM behaviour. Without the use of psychometric methods to study latent phenomena in LLMs, we lack the analytical granularity to assess the validity of the findings. As of yet, it remains unknown whether there is any meaningful latent representation at all, or whether we are chasing cognitive phantoms in LLMs.

To test whether measurement instruments from human psychology can be used to draw valid inferences on latent phenomena from LLM responses, we administered validated psychometric questionnaires designed to measure specific latent constructs in humans. For this validation study, we assume that an LLM is analogous to a 'population' from which random samples can be drawn. We test how well the theorised latent structure is replicated in a human sample and samples from different LLMs, and compare them to one another 2 .

If LLMs contain the same latent phenomena that humans do, the theorised structure should be replicated at least equally well in the LLM samples as in the human sample.

To illustrate the necessity of validation for LLMs, we juxtapose the conclusions from the latent variable approach with the conclusions that would have been drawn from composite scores without a thorough psychometric evaluation.
