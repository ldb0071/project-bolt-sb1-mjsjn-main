## 2.1 Human data

401 human participants were recruited from a representative UK sample (per age, sex and racial identity) via the online crowdsourcing platform Prolific ( www.prolific.com ). We excluded participants that failed an attention check or completed the questionnaires too quickly ( < 6 mins.), resulting in a final sample size of n = 365. The average age was 46.9 years ( SD = 15.31, min. 18 years) with 51.8% female and 84.9% white.
