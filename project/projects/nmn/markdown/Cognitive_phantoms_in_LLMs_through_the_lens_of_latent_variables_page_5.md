## 1.1 Machine behaviour and machine psychology

As an alternative to analytic assessment of the underlying processes in LLMs, adopting a machine behaviourist perspective can be useful [7]. Inspired by the study of animal behaviour, machine behaviour is the study of the behaviour manifested in intelligent machines in terms of development, evolution, function, and underlying mechanisms [7]. Building further on parallels between the study of the human mind and intelligent machines, machine psychology [8] refers to the evaluation of LLMs analogous to participants in language-based psychological studies.

Early findings in the field of machine psychology suggest a semblance of humanness in LLMs. For example, the GPT-3 model was found to be prone to human-like cognitive errors in classic psychological decision-making tests [9]. Other studies have used existing questionnaires to measure personality traits in LLMs [10, 11] and psychological profiles of LLMs at a larger scale [12], one study even reporting a high degree of dark personality traits (psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism) in GPT models compared to average scores in a human sample [13].

The majority of aforementioned constructs would be considered latent variables in psychological theory: these constructs are not directly observable nor directly measurable. Instead, these variables are indirectly measured through measurable behaviours hypothesised to be caused by the underlying latent trait. This approach can be a powerful supplement to the analytic assessment of LLMs: identifying overarching latent phenomena that cause a tendency towards undesired responses (e.g., dark personality patterns that may increase the risk of toxic responses) could help guide targeted adversarial testing strategies for more efficient prevention of harmful output. The indirect measurement of these latent phenomena, usually through a questionnaire or test, has a longstanding tradition in quantitative psychology and is the foundation of the discipline of psychometrics.
