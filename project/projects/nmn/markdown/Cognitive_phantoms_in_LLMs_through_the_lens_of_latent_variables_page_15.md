## 2.4.2 Composite score analysis

To illustrate the necessity of a thorough latent variable approach, we additionally investigated what our findings would have been if we analysed only composite scores per dimension, the current most common method of analysing LLM responses to psychometric questionnaires. Differences between LLM scores and human scores were tested through a set of Kruskal-Wallis tests (non-parametric one-way ANOVA) and followed up with post-hoc Dunn tests with Bonferroni correction.

We additionally calculated correlations between respondents' mean scores on the different dimensions of the DSHS and the Honesty-Humility dimension of the H60. Negative interfactor correlations are consistent with theory and previous findings since these dimensions are conceptual opposites [24], and this approach has previously been used to assess construct validity in LLMs [16]. Note that this analysis is based on composite scores and hinges on a latent structure: inter-factor correlations that are consistent with theory are only meaningful in the presence of a meaningful latent structure in the responses. Differences in inter-factor correlations between the human sample and the LLM samples were considered significant when the 95% confidence interval for difference in correlations did not contain 0 (i.e., 95% confidence that the correlations are not equal in both groups [27]).
