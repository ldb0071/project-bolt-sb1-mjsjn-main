## 2.1 Human behavior Simulation

Recently, LLMs have demonstrated intelligence comparable to humans in certain tasks (bench authors, 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023). Many studies endeavor to harness the LLMs to simulate human behavior and social interactions in social science, economics, psychology, and human-computer interaction for prototyping theories and generating synthetic research data (Park et al., 2022, 2023; Argyle et al., 2023; Horton, 2023; Hämäläinen et al., 2023). Other studies prompt LMs(LLMs) with profiles to simulate human conversations in role-playing and personalized dialogue (Zhang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2019, 2020; Wang et al., 2023b). However, the profile of their work is concise. The limited amount of personal information provided is insufficient for the model to acquire sufficient knowledge to simulate a character accurately.
