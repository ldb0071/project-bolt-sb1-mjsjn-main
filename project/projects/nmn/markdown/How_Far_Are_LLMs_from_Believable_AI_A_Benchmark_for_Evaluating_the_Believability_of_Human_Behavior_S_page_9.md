Character Dataset We selected characters from TV dramas of popular genres 2 : The Simpsons (Animated), Friends (Comedy), Breaking Bad (Crime), and The Rings of Power (Science fiction). According to the profile descriptive framework, we extract the profile information from the fandom 3 . As shown in Table 1, the profile in our work contains 3,277 tokens on average, which is comprehensive in comparison to prior studies. As an illustration, the profile mentioned in the well-known study by Park et al. (2023) only contains 203 tokens.

We recruit four human annotators to carefully verify the collected data and ensure the profiles are error-free. Each annotator completed an extensive ten-hour training program that covered the functioning of the profile descriptive framework and the methods for detecting data errors. If they encounter characters that they find unappealing or unfamiliar, we will halt their annotation process.
