## 1.3 The validity problem for LLMs

Validity is not a methodological problem but rather a theoretical one [14]. The existence of latent phenomena and their causal effects on the measurement outcomes cannot be proven due to their unobservable nature - they must be founded in extensive psychological theory to say that there is a justifiable expectation that a test or questionnaire reasonably measures the phenomenon it purports to measure [14]. This is already a difficult problem in human psychological research, let alone for machine psychological research where substantive theory does not yet exist.

Although validity cannot be established through empirical methods, validation studies can supplement theory-based hypotheses on latent phenomena and their causal effects on measurable behavioural outcomes. For example, we can test whether there is a common latent factor that causes the covariance among a set of items that should reflect the same underlying trait. This approach does not guarantee that the common factor represents a specific latent phenomenon, nor does it provide information on the actual causal process at play between a latent phenomenon and measurement outcomes. However, it does provide plausibility for the measurement model under the assumption that the latent phenomenon exists and that it can reasonably be measured using the measurement instrument.

An additional complexity for LLMs pertains to a measurement unit problem, namely, whether an LLM can be considered analogous to a 'population' versus an 'individual'. This issue is straightforward for humans but unknown for LLMs, yet imperative to the application of appropriate methods. As LLMs are trained on vast corpora of humanwritten data, they represent a diverse range of information, perspectives, and writing styles extracted from text written by countless individual people. When prompted, the LLM samples from its learned distribution to generate a response. An LLM could be seen as analogous to an approximation of the population distribution of language and information in the training data, or as analogous to a single 'average' individual. This distinction has far-reaching implications for validation studies, because no instrument can be validated on a single individual.
