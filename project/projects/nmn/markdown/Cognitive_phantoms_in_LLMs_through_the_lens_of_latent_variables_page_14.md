## 2.4.1 Latent variable approach

Differences in latent representations were assessed by comparing factor structures between the human sample and the LLM samples through factor analysis (FA). Broadly speaking, there are two types of FA: exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We first assessed the assumptions of FA (linearity and multivariate normality of items, factorability of the variables, absence of extreme multicollinearity and outlier variables) [25]. Some violation of linearity and normality is acceptable, so long as there is no true curvilinearity and non-normality is mitigated through robust estimation methods [25, 26]. The remaining assumptions imply the existence of a latent structure (or lack thereof - in which case there is no latent variable to be estimated).

An EFA is a descriptive analysis to determine the underlying factors (dimensions) that cause variation and covariation in the responses to a set of items [26]. Factors should be meaningfully interpretable - that is, a set of items that belong to the same factor should be conceptually similar to one another [25]. For example, the items 'In social situations, I'm usually the one who makes the first move' and 'The first thing that I always do in a new place is to make friends' are easily interpretable as items that relate to extraversion [20].

On the other hand, a CFA is usually performed to verify a strong a priori expectation about the theorised latent structure, often based on EFA results in a previous study [26]. The expected factor structure is specified before running the analysis, including the number of dimensions and patterns in item-factor relationships. A CFA attempts to reproduce the observed variance-covariance matrix of the items, based on the specified factor structure [25]. The similarity of the reproduced variance-covariance matrix is then compared to the observed matrix and assessed by a combination of different fit indices (e.g., SRMR, RMSEA, and CFI) 3 , where acceptable fit provides evidence for the hypothesised factor structure in the current sample [26].

We performed CFA on each sample that adequately met the assumptions to verify the latent structures found in previous research [20, 22], assessing model fit through SRMR, RMSEA, and CFI. Potential alternative factor structures were explored with EFAs. For each group, the number of factors was chosen as the number of factors with eigenvalues exceeding 1 following inspection of a scree plot. Factors were extracted using principal axis factoring (PAF) and oblique rotation to account for non-normality and multicollinearity, and resulting factor structures were compared between humans and the LLMs 4 .
