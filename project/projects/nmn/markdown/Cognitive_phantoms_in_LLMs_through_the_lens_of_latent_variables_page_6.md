## 1.2 Latent variables and psychometrics for LLMs

Administering readily available questionnaires seems like a quick way to accurately measure latent traits in LLMs. Many studies on latent traits in LLMs apply existing measurement instruments, constructed for human samples. In psychometric terms, these studies thus aim to infer from LLMs various latent traits that might systematically affect model behaviour. A test or questionnaire is administered to an LLM, and the resulting responses are aggregated into composite scores (e.g., a mean dimension score) and interpreted - often in relation to human samples - as a proxy for the latent trait of interest. However, this approach relies on crucial yet rarely acknowledged assumptions regarding the validity of the measurements in LLMs.

The validity of a questionnaire refers to the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure. It depends firstly on the existence of the latent trait, and secondly on the notion that changes in the latent trait cause changes in the observed responses [14]. Administering an existing questionnaire validated on human samples presupposes that the latent trait of interest exists in LLMs. It further presupposes that the administered questionnaire measures the respective trait, and that it is measured equivalently in humans and LLMs. Aquestionnaire that is validated on human samples certainly does not guarantee that it is valid for LLMs: LLMs will always generate some response, which may be used to calculate a mean score on certain latent dimensions (e.g., the degree of psychopathy in the models), but that does not mean that this score is meaningful or that the latent phenomenon exists in LLMs at all. Relying on composite scores without acknowledging this problem may thus create the illusion of humanness in LLMs.

Although a handful of studies have performed psychometric evaluations of LLM responses, assessments have either been limited to reliability or validation studies using composite

scores [15, 16], or estimating reliability without considering validity 1 [18]. Others acknowledge the need to evaluate whether tests correctly measure a latent trait of interest in LLMs [12, 19], although this notion still presupposes that the latent trait exists in LLMs to begin with.
