## 2.3 Feedback Guided Safety Finetuning

As emphasizing on safety alone may lead the model to be over-conservative (Bai et al., 2022b), we use feedback from both reward models S s and S h as a measure for the target model M tgt . More specifically, at iteration i , we trained M tgt on its own response by selecting the best subset R i tgt from its own response set A i tgt . Ideally, a safe and

helpful model response should first address immediate safety concerns and risks if applicable, then provide additional information if possible. Toward this end, we select candidates by both helpfulness and safety RM scores s s and s h . At each iteration i , we input adversarial generation P i gen to M tgt and denote its output as A i tgt . For each pair ( p, a ) ∈ ( P i gen , A i tgt ) , denote the safety and helpfulness scores evaluated by S s and S h as s s and s h , we include a into the high-quality response set R i tgt if s s > θ s tgt and s h > θ h tgt . The data selection is illustrated in Algorithms 2, we further provide three illustrative examples in Table 2. We then use P i gen and R i tgt for supervised fine-tuning of M tgt .

In practice, we found the size of R i tgt are relatively small sometimes. However, directly relexing θ s tgt and θ h tgt may lower data quality. Inspired by previous studies (Touvron et al., 2023b), we combined MART along with context distillation and rejection sampling at certain iterations.

Context Distillation At the first iteration, the safety performance of the target model is relatively low, with fewer samples whose RM scores pass the two thresholds. We thus expand R 1 tgt with context distillation (Askell et al., 2021). This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety preprompt 1 . We combine the generations after context distillation with A 1 tgt , and perform Select() on A 1 tgt . We did not use context distillation in the following iterations as we no longer observed essential performance improvement. When the output quality from M tgt improves, using a safety preprompt may result in response degradation as the model tends to become

In the second example, the model refused directly without further user education, thus ranked as safe but not helpful enough. The third example illustrates a helpful and harmless answer. We replace sensitive words with 'XXX' to reduce toxicity.
