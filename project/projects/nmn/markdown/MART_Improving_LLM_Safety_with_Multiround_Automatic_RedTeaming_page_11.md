Rejection Sampling At the last iteration T -1 , we find the model tends to converge on the generated adversarial prompts. There is no significant change of safety performance when compared to the last iteration, leading to limited samples collected in A T -1 tgt and motivating us to enrich the candidate set through rejection sampling. Instead of sampling one answer per prompt, we sample K answers for each prompt from the most recent target model. To increase sampling diversity and quantity, we alter the sampling temperature at different runs. This results in an enlarged response set A T -1 tgt as input for Select() . During data selection, we randomly sample one answer into R T -1 tgt if there are multiple selected answers for the same prompt.
