## 3.1 Profile Descriptive Framework and Character Dataset

Comprehensive profile information is necessary for LLMs to simulate human behavior accurately. Accordingly, we propose the profile descriptive framework and collect a character dataset based on this framework. For more details, please refer to the Appendix A.

Profile Descriptive Framework We propose a descriptive framework that comprehensively documents a character's information from three aspects: Immutable Characteristic , Social Role , Relationship . Immutable characteristic (Stein, 2001) refers to characteristics that cannot be easily changed, such as name, gender, and age. Social role (Wasserman, 1994; Eagly and Wood, 2012) is conceptualized as a set of connected behaviors, obligations, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation. Relationship (Sztompka, 2002) is the basic element of study in the field of social sciences and refers to any interpersonal connection between two or more individuals. Furthermore, these three kinds of profile information are thoroughly elaborated by fine-grained aspects based on established theories. For example, we will comprehensively document the following aspects of the relationship: familiarity , judgment , affection , behavioral patterns , relationship status , and communication history .
